# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description
You are tasked with writing a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. In simpler terms, you need to add two numbers together.

### Example Input and Output
**Input:**
- Number 1: 5
- Number 2: 7

**Output:**
- Sum: 12

### Constraints
- The input numbers will be integers.
- The input numbers can be positive, negative, or zero.

## Understand the Problem
Before diving into writing code, let's break down the problem and think about what needs to be done. We want to perform a basic arithmetic operation, addition, on two numbers. It's crucial to understand the problem fully before attempting to solve it.

## Possible Approaches
There's usually just one straightforward way to solve this problem - adding the two input numbers together. However, let's explore different ways to approach this problem:

1. **Using a Function**: Define a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
2. **Using a Command-Line Input**: Accept input from the user through the command line or console.
3. **Using a GUI**: Create a graphical user interface where users can input two numbers and get the sum as output.

## Plan the Approach
The most common approach is to create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. Here's the plan:

1. Define a function, let's call it `add_numbers`, that accepts two parameters, `number1` and `number2`.
2. Inside the function, add `number1` and `number2` together.
3. Return the result of the addition.

This approach is simple and effective for solving this problem.

## Algorithm
Now, let's formalize the approach into an algorithm:

1. Start
2. Define a function `add_numbers` that takes two parameters: `number1` and `number2`.
3. Inside the function:
   - Add `number1` and `number2` together.
   - Assign the result to a variable, let's call it `sum_result`.
4. Return `sum_result` as the output of the function.
5. End

## Pseudocode
Here's the pseudocode representation of the algorithm:

```plaintext
Function add_numbers(number1, number2):
    sum_result = number1 + number2
    Return sum_result
```

## Test Cases
Let's test our program with various inputs to ensure it works correctly:

1. Test with positive numbers:
   - Input: Number 1 = 5, Number 2 = 7
   - Expected Output: Sum = 12

2. Test with negative numbers:
   - Input: Number 1 = -3, Number 2 = -5
   - Expected Output: Sum = -8

3. Test with zero:
   - Input: Number 1 = 0, Number 2 = 0
   - Expected Output: Sum = 0

4. Test with one positive and one negative number:
   - Input: Number 1 = 10, Number 2 = -3
   - Expected Output: Sum = 7

5. Test with large numbers (to check for overflow, depending on the programming language used).

## Final Remarks
Now that you understand the problem and have a clear plan, try to implement the solution on your own before checking the code. Understanding the problem-solving process is valuable.
