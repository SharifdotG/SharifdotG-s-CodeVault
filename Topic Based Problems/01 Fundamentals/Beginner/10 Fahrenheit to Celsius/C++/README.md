# Code Guide - Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion

## Introduction

This Code Guide explains the implementation of a simple C++ program to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. This problem falls under the category of basic mathematical computations and is commonly encountered in everyday life when dealing with temperature conversions.

## Problem Description

### Problem Statement

Given a temperature in Fahrenheit, the task is to convert it to Celsius.

### Input

- A floating-point number representing the temperature in Fahrenheit.

### Output

- The temperature converted to Celsius, displayed with two decimal places.

## About the Problem

### History

The Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion is a fundamental temperature conversion formula developed by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, a Polish-German physicist, and engineer. Fahrenheit introduced the Fahrenheit scale in the early 18th century, which was widely used in the United States. The Celsius scale, developed by Anders Celsius, is more commonly used worldwide, making temperature conversions between the two scales a practical necessity.

### Information and Trivia

- The Fahrenheit to Celsius formula is: (°F - 32) × 5/9 = °C.
- Fahrenheit scale is commonly used in the United States, while Celsius (also known as Centigrade) is the standard in most other countries.
- Water boils at 212°F (100°C) and freezes at 32°F (0°C) on the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales, respectively.

## Approach

### Implementation

The program's approach is straightforward. It takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as input, applies the conversion formula, and displays the result in Celsius. Here are the key steps:

1. Accept user input for the temperature in Fahrenheit.
2. Apply the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion formula: (°F - 32) × 5/9.
3. Display the result with two decimal places.

### Algorithm & Data Structures

The algorithm primarily involves a simple mathematical calculation using basic arithmetic operators. No complex data structures are needed for this task.

## Code Walkthrough

Let's break down the code into logical sections and explain each part step-by-step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    double fahrenheit;

    // Accept user input for the temperature in Fahrenheit
    cout << "Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: ";
    cin >> fahrenheit;

    // Apply the conversion formula and display the result in Celsius
    cout << "Temperature in Celsius is: " << fixed << setprecision(2) << (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9 << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

- We include the necessary header files (`<iostream>` and `<iomanip>`) for input/output operations and formatting.
- We declare a variable `fahrenheit` to store the input temperature in Fahrenheit.
- We prompt the user to enter the temperature in Fahrenheit and read the input.
- We use `fixed` and `setprecision(2)` to ensure that the result is displayed with two decimal places.
- The conversion formula is applied within the `cout` statement, and the result is displayed.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this program is constant (O(1)) because the execution time does not depend on the input size. It performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the temperature value entered.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is also constant (O(1)) as it only uses a fixed amount of memory to store the `fahrenheit` variable and some temporary memory for input/output.

### Efficiency

The solution is highly efficient, and there is no room for optimization since the conversion formula involves only basic arithmetic operations.

## Execution

To understand how the code is executed from source code to binary code, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Preprocessing: In this stage, the C++ preprocessor handles directives like `#include` and replaces them with the content of the included files.

2. Compilation: The preprocessed code is compiled into machine code (binary code) by the C++ compiler. This machine code is specific to the target platform.

3. Linking: If there are any external libraries or functions used, the linker combines them with the binary code to create the final executable.

4. Execution: The resulting executable can be run on a compatible system, and it will execute the code as intended.

## Examples

This code can be implemented in various scenarios, such as:

- Weather applications to convert temperature data between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
- Scientific calculations involving temperature conversions.
- Cooking recipes that require temperature adjustments between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## Test Cases

Here are some test cases to validate the code:

**Test Case 1:**

- Input: 98.6 (body temperature in Fahrenheit)
- Output: 37.00 (body temperature in Celsius)

**Test Case 2:**

- Input: 32.0 (freezing point of water in Fahrenheit)
- Output: 0.00 (freezing point of water in Celsius)

**Test Case 3:**

- Input: 212.0 (boiling point of water in Fahrenheit)
- Output: 100.00 (boiling point of water in Celsius)

**Test Case 4:**

- Input: -40.0 (the temperature at which Fahrenheit and Celsius scales are the same)
- Output: -40.00

### Rationale

These test cases cover a range of temperatures, including negative values, the freezing and boiling points of water, and a key conversion point where both Fahrenheit and Celsius scales align (-40 degrees).

## Troubleshooting

Common issues users might encounter:

1. **Input Validation**: The code assumes valid input (a numeric value). Users should ensure they enter a valid number to avoid runtime errors.

2. **Incorrect Formula**: Double-check that the conversion formula `(fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9` is correctly implemented in the code.

3. **Formatting Issues**: If the output is not displayed with two decimal places, check that `fixed` and `setprecision(2)` are correctly applied.
