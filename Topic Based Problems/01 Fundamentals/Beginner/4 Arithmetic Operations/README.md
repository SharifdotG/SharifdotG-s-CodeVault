# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description
You are tasked with writing a program that performs arithmetic operations between two numbers. Your program should take two numbers as input and perform various arithmetic operations on them. The goal is to create a versatile calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder between two numbers.

## Example Input and Output
**Input:**
```
Number 1: 10
Number 2: 5
```

**Output:**
```
Addition: 10 + 5 = 15
Subtraction: 10 - 5 = 5
Multiplication: 10 * 5 = 50
Division: 10 / 5 = 2.0
Remainder: 10 % 5 = 0
```

## Constraints
- The input numbers are integers.
- The division operation should return a floating-point number.

## Understand the Problem
Before jumping into writing code, let's break down the problem:

1. You're given two numbers.
2. You need to perform five different arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder.
3. The input should be taken from the user, and the results should be displayed clearly.

## Possible Approaches
There are multiple ways to solve this problem:

1. **Simple Approach:** You can use basic arithmetic operators in your programming language to perform each operation separately.

2. **Function-Based Approach:** You can create separate functions for each operation to keep your code organized and modular.

3. **Switch Statement Approach:** If your programming language supports switch statements, you can use one to select which operation to perform based on user input.

## Plan the Approach
Let's take the simple approach for this guide. We'll use basic arithmetic operators to perform each operation. You'll need to:

- Read two numbers from the user.
- Perform addition by adding the two numbers.
- Perform subtraction by subtracting the second number from the first.
- Perform multiplication by multiplying the two numbers.
- Perform division by dividing the first number by the second.
- Perform remainder by finding the remainder when the first number is divided by the second.

## Algorithm
Here's a high-level algorithm for the simple approach:

1. Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in a variable.
2. Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in another variable.
3. Calculate the addition by adding the two numbers and store the result.
4. Calculate the subtraction by subtracting the second number from the first and store the result.
5. Calculate the multiplication by multiplying the two numbers and store the result.
6. Calculate the division by dividing the first number by the second and store the result.
7. Calculate the remainder by finding the remainder when the first number is divided by the second and store the result.
8. Display the results for each operation.

## Pseudocode
Here's a pseudocode representation of the algorithm:

```plaintext
1. Input first_number
2. Input second_number
3. addition_result = first_number + second_number
4. subtraction_result = first_number - second_number
5. multiplication_result = first_number * second_number
6. division_result = first_number / second_number
7. remainder_result = first_number % second_number
8. Output "Addition:", first_number, "+", second_number, "=", addition_result
9. Output "Subtraction:", first_number, "-", second_number, "=", subtraction_result
10. Output "Multiplication:", first_number, "*", second_number, "=", multiplication_result
11. Output "Division:", first_number, "/", second_number, "=", division_result
12. Output "Remainder:", first_number, "%", second_number, "=", remainder_result
```

## Test Cases
Test your program with various test cases, including edge cases:

- Test with positive integers.
- Test with negative integers.
- Test with zero as one of the numbers.
- Test with non-integer floating-point numbers.

## Final Remarks
Now that you have a clear plan and pseudocode, try implementing the solution in your preferred programming language. Understanding the problem and having a structured approach is key to writing clean and efficient code.
