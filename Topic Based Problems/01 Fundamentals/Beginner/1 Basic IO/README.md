# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description

In this coding challenge, we will tackle a classic problem: Basic I/O. The goal is to read input from the user and provide appropriate output. This is a fundamental skill in programming and a necessary step in solving more complex problems.

**Input**: The input can vary depending on the problem but often includes data from the user or external sources. It could be numbers, text, files, or any other form of input.

**Output**: The output is the result or response generated by your program based on the given input. It could be displaying information, performing calculations, or saving data.

## Example Input and Output

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the concept:

**Problem**: Create a program that takes a user's name as input and greets them.

**Input**:
```
Enter your name: Alice
```

**Output**:
```
Hello, Alice! Nice to meet you.
```

## Constraints

- The input can vary widely depending on the specific problem.
- The output should be relevant to the input and follow the problem's requirements.

## Understand the Problem

Before diving into the code, it's crucial to understand the problem thoroughly. Consider the following:

- What type of input is expected?
- What should the program do with the input?
- What kind of output is needed?
- Are there any specific conditions or rules to follow?

## Possible Approaches

1. **Direct Input/Output**: For simple problems like the greeting example, you can directly read input from the user and provide output. This approach is suitable for straightforward tasks.

2. **Conditional Logic**: For more complex problems, you might need to use conditional statements (if, else) to handle different cases based on the input.

3. **Data Processing**: In some cases, you might need to process or manipulate the input data before generating the output.

## Plan the Approach

Let's plan a basic approach for a program that takes two numbers as input, calculates their sum, and displays the result. This will involve reading, processing, and displaying data.

## Algorithm

1. Display a message to prompt the user to enter the first number.
2. Read the first number from the user's input.
3. Display a message to prompt the user to enter the second number.
4. Read the second number from the user's input.
5. Calculate the sum of the two numbers.
6. Display the result to the user.

## Pseudocode

Here's a pseudocode representation of the algorithm:

```
1. Display "Enter the first number: "
2. Read firstNumber from user input
3. Display "Enter the second number: "
4. Read secondNumber from user input
5. Calculate sum = firstNumber + secondNumber
6. Display "The sum is: " + sum
```

## Test Cases

Test your program with various inputs to ensure it works correctly:

- Input: 5, 7
  Output: The sum is: 12

- Input: -2, 3
  Output: The sum is: 1

- Input: 0, 0
  Output: The sum is: 0

## Final Remarks

Now that you understand the process of handling basic input and output, it's time to apply these principles to solve more complex problems. Remember to break down the problem, plan your approach, and test your solution thoroughly.
