# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description
Welcome to the "Hello World" code guide! This classic programming challenge is an excellent way to get started with coding. The goal is simple: to print the phrase "Hello, World!" to the screen. This problem serves as a foundational exercise to understand the basics of input, output, and running a program.

### Example Input and Output
**Input**: None (No input is required for this problem)

**Output**:  
```
Hello, World!
```

### Constraints
- There are no specific constraints for this problem. It's a basic introduction to programming, so you can use any programming language you prefer.

## Understand the Problem
Before diving into coding, let's break down the problem:

1. **What is the problem asking for?**  
   The problem asks you to write a program that displays the phrase "Hello, World!" on the screen.

2. **What is the input?**  
   There is no input required for this problem. You just need to output a specific text.

3. **What is the output?**  
   The output should be the phrase "Hello, World!" printed to the screen.

## Possible Approaches
This is a straightforward problem, and there's really only one way to solve it: by using the appropriate commands to print the desired text. However, you can approach this problem in various programming languages.

## Plan the Approach
To solve this problem, you need to use the appropriate syntax for outputting text in your chosen programming language. You should:

- Identify the programming language you'll use.
- Use the correct command or function to print the text "Hello, World!".

## Algorithm
1. Choose your programming language.
2. Use the appropriate command or function to print "Hello, World!".

## Pseudocode
Here's a pseudocode representation of the solution using Python as the programming language:

```plaintext
1. Print "Hello, World!"
```

## Test Cases
Test your program with the following scenarios:

1. **Input**: None
   - **Expected Output**: "Hello, World!"

2. **Input**: None
   - **Expected Output**: "Hello, World!"

3. **Input**: None
   - **Expected Output**: "Hello, World!"

Remember to adapt the pseudocode and testing to your chosen programming language.

## Additional Guidance
This problem is intentionally simple, but it's an essential first step for anyone learning to code. If you're new to programming, consider using online resources, tutorials, or introductory courses in your chosen programming language to help you get started. Don't hesitate to seek help from the programming community if you encounter difficulties.

Now, go ahead and write your "Hello, World!" program. Understanding this basic concept will set the foundation for more complex programming challenges in the future. Enjoy your coding journey!
