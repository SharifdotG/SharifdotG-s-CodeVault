# Code Guide - The Only Guide You Need!

## Introduction:
This Code Guide is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the "Rectangle Area" problem and its solution. The problem revolves around calculating the area of a rectangle based on user input for its length and width. By following this guide, you'll gain insights into how to approach and implement this problem effectively.

## Problem Description:
1. **Problem Statement**: Given the length and width of a rectangle, calculate and display its area.
2. **Input**: The program takes two integer inputs: length and width of the rectangle.
3. **Output**: It displays the calculated area of the rectangle.

## About the Problem:
### History:
The concept of calculating the area of a rectangle is fundamental in mathematics and has numerous real-life applications, such as in construction, architecture, and design. This problem has been a fundamental building block in geometry for centuries.

### Information and Trivia:
- The formula to calculate the area of a rectangle is: `Area = Length x Width`.
- The rectangle area problem is a simplified version of more complex geometric area calculations.
- Understanding this problem is crucial for solving more advanced geometry and math-related challenges.

## Approach:
### Implementation:
The problem can be solved by following a straightforward approach:
1. Take user input for the length and width of the rectangle.
2. Multiply the length and width to calculate the area.
3. Display the calculated area to the user.

### Algorithm & Data Structures:
No complex algorithms or data structures are needed for this problem. It relies on basic arithmetic operations.

## Code Walkthrough:
Let's break down the provided code into logical sections:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class RectangleArea {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int length, width;

        System.out.print("Enter length: ");
        length = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter width: ");
        width = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println("Area of rectangle is: " + (length * width));

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

1. We start by importing the necessary `Scanner` class for user input.
2. We declare two integer variables, `length` and `width`, to store the user-provided values.
3. We prompt the user to enter the length and width.
4. We calculate the area by multiplying `length` and `width`.
5. Finally, we display the calculated area to the user.

## Complexity Analysis:
1. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this code is constant, O(1), as it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size.
2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(1) as it uses a fixed amount of memory to store variables.

## Execution:
To understand how this code is executed under the hood, it goes through the following steps:
1. The Java source code is compiled into bytecode.
2. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) translates the bytecode into machine code.
3. The CPU executes the machine code, performing the calculations and displaying the result.

## Examples:
This code can be applied in various scenarios, such as:
- Calculating the area of a room for flooring or painting.
- Determining the area of a piece of land for construction purposes.
- Designing graphics and layouts on a computer.

## Test Cases:
Here are some test cases to validate the code:
1. **Input**: Length = 5, Width = 3
   **Output**: Area of rectangle is: 15

2. **Input**: Length = 10, Width = 7
   **Output**: Area of rectangle is: 70

3. **Input**: Length = 0, Width = 12
   **Output**: Area of rectangle is: 0

### Troubleshooting:
- Ensure that you enter valid integer values for length and width.
- If the code doesn't execute, check for syntax errors or IDE/compiler issues.
