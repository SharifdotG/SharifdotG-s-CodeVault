# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description
You are given the width and height of a rectangle. Your task is to calculate the area of the rectangle. The input consists of two positive integers representing the width and height of the rectangle. The output should be a single integer representing the area of the rectangle.

### Example Input and Output
**Input:**  
Width: 5  
Height: 7

**Output:**  
Area: 35

### Constraints
- The width and height are positive integers.
- Width and height values are within the range of 1 to 1000.

## Understand the Problem
To solve this problem, we need to find the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: `Area = Width x Height`. 

Before jumping into writing code, let's think about different approaches to solving this problem.

## Possible Approaches
There is a straightforward approach to solving this problem:

1. Use the provided formula to calculate the area of the rectangle.

## Plan the Approach
The plan for solving this problem is quite simple:

1. Take input for the width and height of the rectangle.
2. Use the formula `Area = Width x Height` to calculate the area.
3. Print the calculated area as the output.

## Algorithm
1. Read the width and height of the rectangle as input.
2. Calculate the area using the formula `Area = Width x Height`.
3. Print the calculated area as the output.

## Pseudocode
```plaintext
1. Input: width, height
2. area = width * height
3. Output: area
```

## Test Cases
Let's test our solution with some test cases to ensure its correctness:

**Test Case 1:**
Input:  
Width: 5  
Height: 7  
Output: 35

**Test Case 2:**
Input:  
Width: 10  
Height: 3  
Output: 30

**Test Case 3:**
Input:  
Width: 1  
Height: 1000  
Output: 1000

**Test Case 4:**
Input:  
Width: 500  
Height: 1  
Output: 500

**Test Case 5:**
Input:  
Width: 1000  
Height: 1000  
Output: 1000000

## Additional Guidance
- Make sure to handle the input and output as integers.
- Double-check that your solution works for both small and large values of width and height.
- Remember to follow the provided pseudocode and algorithm as a guideline.
