# Code Guide - Rectangle Perimeter

## Introduction

This Code Guide is designed to help you understand the implementation of the "Rectangle Perimeter" problem. The problem involves calculating the perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width. We'll provide a step-by-step explanation of the code, its purpose, and how it solves the problem.

## Problem Description

### Problem Statement
Given the length and width of a rectangle, calculate and print its perimeter.

### Input
- Two integers: length and width of the rectangle.

### Output
- The perimeter of the rectangle.

## About the Problem

### History
The concept of calculating the perimeter of a rectangle is fundamental in mathematics and has practical applications in various fields, including engineering, architecture, and computer graphics. It's essential for determining the distance around a rectangular shape.

### Information and Trivia
- The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to twice the sum of its length and width.
- The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: `perimeter = 2 * (length + width)`.

## Approach

### Implementation
The code follows a straightforward approach to solving the problem:
1. Read the length and width of the rectangle from the user.
2. Calculate the perimeter using the provided formula.
3. Print the calculated perimeter.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
- No complex algorithms or data structures are used in this code. It relies on basic arithmetic operations.

## Code Walkthrough

Let's break down the code into logical sections and explain each part step-by-step:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class RectanglePerimeter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to read user input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Declare variables to store length and width
        int length, width;

        // Prompt the user to enter the length
        System.out.print("Enter length: ");
        length = scanner.nextInt();

        // Prompt the user to enter the width
        System.out.print("Enter width: ");
        width = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculate and print the perimeter
        System.out.println("Perimeter of rectangle is: " + 2 * (length + width));

        // Close the scanner to release resources
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- We import the `Scanner` class to read user input.
- Variables `length` and `width` are declared to store the user-provided values.
- The user is prompted to enter the length and width.
- The perimeter is calculated using the formula `2 * (length + width)` and printed to the console.
- Finally, the scanner is closed to release resources.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- The code's time complexity is O(1) because it performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations regardless of the input values.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of memory to store the input values and variables.

### Efficiency
- The solution is highly efficient, with constant time and space complexity.

## Execution

To execute the code:
1. Compile the Java source code using a Java compiler.
2. Run the compiled program, and it will interactively prompt you to enter the length and width of the rectangle.

## Examples

This code can be implemented in scenarios where you need to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, such as architectural design, construction planning, or computer graphics applications.

## Test Cases

Here are some test cases with input and expected output to validate the code:

- Test Case 1:
  - Input: Length = 5, Width = 3
  - Expected Output: Perimeter of rectangle is: 16

- Test Case 2:
  - Input: Length = 10, Width = 7
  - Expected Output: Perimeter of rectangle is: 34

- Test Case 3:
  - Input: Length = 0, Width = 0
  - Expected Output: Perimeter of rectangle is: 0

## Troubleshooting

Common issues or errors:
- Ensure you have a Java development environment set up to compile and run the code.
- Make sure you provide valid integer values for length and width.
