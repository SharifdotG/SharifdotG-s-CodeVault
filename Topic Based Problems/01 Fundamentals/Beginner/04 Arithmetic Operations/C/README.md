By the end, you'll have a deep understanding of how this code calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two numbers.

## Problem Description
This code addresses the problem of performing basic arithmetic operations on two input numbers. It calculates and displays the sum, difference, product, and quotient of these numbers.

### Problem Statement
Given two integers, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`, the program computes and prints:
- The sum of `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`.
- The difference of `firstNumber` minus `secondNumber`.
- The product of `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`.
- The quotient of `firstNumber` divided by `secondNumber`.

### Input
- Two integers, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`, provided by the user.

### Output
- The sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two input numbers.

## About the Problem
### History
The need to perform basic arithmetic operations on numbers is a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer science. Such operations are used in various real-life applications, from calculating financial transactions to solving scientific problems.

### Information and Trivia
- Arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- These operations are essential in computer programming for tasks like calculations, data manipulation, and decision-making.

## Approach
### Implementation
To solve this problem, we use a straightforward approach:
1. Read two integer inputs, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`, from the user.
2. Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient using basic arithmetic operations.
3. Display the results using `printf` statements.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
No complex algorithms or data structures are required for this problem. Simple arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) are used to perform calculations.

## Code Walkthrough
Let's break down the code into logical sections:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int firstNumber, secondNumber;

    // Input: Read two integers from the user
    printf("Enter first number: ");
    scanf("%d", &firstNumber);

    printf("Enter second number: ");
    scanf("%d", &secondNumber);

    // Perform arithmetic operations and display results
    printf("Sum of %d and %d is: %d\n", firstNumber, secondNumber, firstNumber + secondNumber);
    printf("Difference of %d and %d is: %d\n", firstNumber, secondNumber, firstNumber - secondNumber);
    printf("Product of %d and %d is: %d\n", firstNumber, secondNumber, firstNumber * secondNumber);
    printf("Quotient of %d and %d is: %d\n", firstNumber, secondNumber, firstNumber / secondNumber);

    return 0;
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(1) - The code runs in constant time as it performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations.
- Space Complexity: O(1) - The code uses a constant amount of memory to store variables.

### Efficiency
This solution is highly efficient for performing basic arithmetic operations, and there are no apparent areas for improvement.

## Execution
The execution process involves compiling and running the C code. The source code is translated into binary code by the compiler, which is then executed by the computer's CPU.

## Examples
This code can be implemented in various real-life scenarios, such as:
- Calculating the total cost of items in a shopping cart.
- Determining the change to be given in a point-of-sale system.
- Solving mathematical problems involving arithmetic operations.

## Test Cases
Here are some test cases to validate the code:

1. **Input:** `firstNumber = 5`, `secondNumber = 3`
   - **Output:**
     ```
     Sum of 5 and 3 is: 8
     Difference of 5 and 3 is: 2
     Product of 5 and 3 is: 15
     Quotient of 5 and 3 is: 1
     ```

2. **Input:** `firstNumber = 10`, `secondNumber = 2`
   - **Output:**
     ```
     Sum of 10 and 2 is: 12
     Difference of 10 and 2 is: 8
     Product of 10 and 2 is: 20
     Quotient of 10 and 2 is: 5
     ```

3. **Input:** `firstNumber = -7`, `secondNumber = 4`
   - **Output:**
     ```
     Sum of -7 and 4 is: -3
     Difference of -7 and 4 is: -11
     Product of -7 and 4 is: -28
     Quotient of -7 and 4 is: -1
     ```

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure that the user provides valid integer inputs.
- Handle cases where the second number is zero to avoid division by zero errors.
