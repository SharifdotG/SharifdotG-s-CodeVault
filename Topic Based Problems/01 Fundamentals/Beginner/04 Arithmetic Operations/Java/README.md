# Code Guide - The Only Guide You Need!

## Introduction
This Code Guide explores the implementation of a Java program called "ArithmeticOperations," which solves various arithmetic operations on two input numbers. The program allows users to input two numbers and then performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (if the second number is not zero). This guide will provide a step-by-step breakdown of the code, explain the problem it addresses, and offer insights into its execution and efficiency.

## Problem Description
The problem tackled by the "ArithmeticOperations" program involves performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-input numbers. The program takes two integers as input and produces results for each operation, ensuring it handles division by zero gracefully.

### Problem Statement
Given two integers, perform the following operations:
1. Add the two numbers.
2. Subtract the second number from the first.
3. Multiply the two numbers.
4. If the second number is not zero, divide the first number by the second.

### Input
- Two integers (firstNumber and secondNumber).

### Output
- Sum of the two numbers.
- Difference of the two numbers.
- Product of the two numbers.
- Quotient of the two numbers (if the second number is not zero), or a message indicating division by zero.

## About the Problem
### History
Arithmetic operations are fundamental in mathematics and computer science. These operations have been used in various fields for centuries to solve practical problems, from calculating finances to designing algorithms.

### Information and Trivia
- Arithmetic operations are essential in computer programming for performing calculations and making decisions based on numeric values.
- Division by zero is undefined in mathematics and can lead to errors in programming, so it must be handled carefully.

## Approach
### Implementation
The "ArithmeticOperations" program takes a straightforward approach to solving the problem:
1. Read two integers from the user using a Scanner.
2. Calculate the sum, difference, and product of the two numbers.
3. If the second number is not zero, calculate the quotient as a floating-point number (to handle division with decimals).
4. Display the results or an error message if division by zero occurs.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
There is no complex algorithm or data structure used in this program. It relies on basic arithmetic operations and conditional statements to perform the required calculations.

## Code Walkthrough
The code can be divided into the following logical sections:

### Input
- The program uses a Scanner to read two integers (firstNumber and secondNumber) from the user.

### Arithmetic Operations
- It calculates the sum, difference, and product of the two numbers using basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *).
- It checks if the second number is zero before performing division and handles division by zero gracefully.

### Output
- The program prints the results of each operation using formatted strings.

### Closing the Scanner
- Finally, the program closes the Scanner to release resources.

### Complexity Analysis
#### Time Complexity
- Reading input and performing arithmetic operations takes constant time, O(1), because the number of operations does not depend on the input size.

#### Space Complexity
- The program uses a constant amount of memory, O(1), as it only stores a few integer variables.

#### Efficiency
- The solution is efficient and straightforward, with no significant areas for optimization due to the simplicity of the problem.

## Execution
The program execution involves the following steps:
1. The Java source code is compiled into bytecode using a Java compiler.
2. The bytecode is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
3. The user interacts with the program through the console, providing input and receiving output.

## Examples
The "ArithmeticOperations" program can be implemented in real-life scenarios wherever basic arithmetic calculations are required. Some examples include:
- Calculating the total cost of items in a shopping cart.
- Determining the change to give a customer in a point-of-sale system.
- Calculating monthly mortgage payments.

## Test Cases
Here are some test cases to validate the code:

**Test Case 1:**
- Input:
  - First Number: 10
  - Second Number: 5
- Expected Output:
  - Sum of 10 and 5 is: 15
  - Difference of 10 and 5 is: 5
  - Product of 10 and 5 is: 50
  - Quotient of 10 and 5 is: 2.0

**Test Case 2:**
- Input:
  - First Number: 20
  - Second Number: 0
- Expected Output:
  - Sum of 20 and 0 is: 20
  - Difference of 20 and 0 is: 20
  - Product of 20 and 0 is: 0
  - Cannot divide by zero.

**Test Case 3:**
- Input:
  - First Number: -15
  - Second Number: 7
- Expected Output:
  - Sum of -15 and 7 is: -8
  - Difference of -15 and 7 is: -22
  - Product of -15 and 7 is: -105
  - Quotient of -15 and 7 is: -2.142857142857143

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
- Ensure that you provide valid integer inputs when running the program.
- If you encounter a "Cannot divide by zero" message, check that the second number is not zero before performing division.

### Solutions
- Input validation can be added to handle non-integer inputs or other unexpected user inputs.
- When dividing by zero, consider providing a more informative error message if needed.
