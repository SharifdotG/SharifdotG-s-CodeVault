# Code Guide - Area of a Square

## Introduction:
This Code Guide addresses the problem of calculating the area of a square given its side length. It is a simple mathematical problem and serves as a basic example of how to perform a calculation in a programming language.

## Problem Description:
1. **Problem Statement:** Calculate the area of a square when the length of one of its sides is given.
2. **Input:** The input consists of a single floating-point number representing the side length of the square.
3. **Output:** The output is the area of the square, rounded to two decimal places.

## About the Problem:
### History:
The concept of finding the area of geometric shapes, including squares, dates back to ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and Greeks. It has been an essential part of mathematics and real-world applications for centuries.

### Information and Trivia:
- The area of a square can also be calculated using the formula: Area = side_length^2.
- Squares are often used in various fields, such as architecture, engineering, and computer graphics.

## Approach:
### Implementation:
The problem is straightforward and doesn't require complex algorithms. The area of a square can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by itself.

### Algorithm & Data Structures:
There is no need for advanced data structures or algorithms in this code. It involves simple arithmetic operations.

## Code Walkthrough:
1. **Input:** The code starts by taking user input for the length of the side of the square.
2. **Calculation:** It then calculates the area by multiplying the side length by itself.
3. **Output:** Finally, it prints the calculated area, rounded to two decimal places.

```python
side = float(input("Enter the side of a Square: "))
print(f"Area of a Square = {side * side:.2f}")
```

## Complexity Analysis:
1. **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this code is O(1) because it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size.
2. **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) as it only stores a single floating-point number.

## Execution:
The code is executed line by line:
1. The user provides input for the side length.
2. The code calculates the area.
3. The result is displayed on the screen.

## Examples:
This code can be applied in various situations, such as:
- Calculating the area of a square garden.
- Determining the space needed for a square tile in a flooring project.

## Test Cases:
Here are some test cases to validate the code:
1. **Input:** 5.0
   **Output:** Area of a Square = 25.00
2. **Input:** 2.5
   **Output:** Area of a Square = 6.25
3. **Input:** 0.0
   **Output:** Area of a Square = 0.00

### Troubleshooting:
- Ensure that the input is a valid positive number.
- Double-check that the code follows proper syntax.
