# Code Guide - Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion

## Introduction

Welcome to the Code Guide for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit! In this guide, we will explore a simple Java program that takes a temperature in Celsius as input and converts it into Fahrenheit. This is a common temperature conversion problem, often encountered in weather forecasting and scientific applications.

## Problem Description

1. **Problem Statement:** The task is to convert a temperature given in degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit.
2. **Input:** The user is prompted to enter a temperature in Celsius.
3. **Output:** The program displays the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit, rounded to two decimal places.

## About the Problem

### History
The Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion formula was developed by the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius in 1742. This scale is commonly used in most of the world except the United States, which primarily uses the Fahrenheit scale.

### Information and Trivia
- The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is: `Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32`.
- The Celsius scale is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, where 0째C is freezing and 100째C is boiling at standard atmospheric pressure.
- The Fahrenheit scale uses 32째F as the freezing point and 212째F as the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure.

## Approach

### Implementation
1. We take user input for the temperature in Celsius.
2. We apply the conversion formula `(Celsius * 9/5) + 32` to calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit.
3. The result is displayed with two decimal places using `System.out.printf`.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
- Algorithm: The algorithm is straightforward, involving a single mathematical operation.
- Data Structures: No specific data structures are used; only basic variables are employed to store the input and output.

## Code Walkthrough

Now, let's break down the code into logical sections and explain each part step-by-step:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CelsiustoFahrenheit {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        double celsius;

        System.out.print("Enter temperature in Celsius: ");
        celsius = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Temperature conversion formula
        double fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;

        // Display the result with two decimal places
        System.out.printf("Temperature in Fahrenheit is: %.2f\n", fahrenheit);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

1. We import the `Scanner` class to enable user input.
2. We declare a variable `celsius` to store the user's input.
3. The user is prompted to enter a temperature in Celsius.
4. The temperature is converted to Fahrenheit using the provided formula and stored in the variable `fahrenheit`.
5. The result is displayed using `System.out.printf`, which formats the output to two decimal places.

## Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this code is O(1) because it performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations regardless of the input size.
2. **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also O(1) as it uses a fixed amount of memory for variables.

### Efficiency

The code is highly efficient for its task since it performs a simple arithmetic operation to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. No optimizations are required.

## Execution

The Java code is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as follows:
1. The Java source code is compiled into bytecode.
2. The JVM interprets and executes the bytecode.

## Examples

This code can be used in various real-life scenarios, such as:
- Weather applications to display temperatures in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Scientific experiments where temperature conversion is necessary.

## Test Cases

Here are some test cases to validate the code:

**Test Case 1:**
- Input: 25.0 (Celsius)
- Output: Temperature in Fahrenheit is: 77.00

**Test Case 2:**
- Input: 0.0 (Celsius)
- Output: Temperature in Fahrenheit is: 32.00

**Test Case 3:**
- Input: -10.5 (Celsius)
- Output: Temperature in Fahrenheit is: 13.10

### Rationale
These test cases cover positive, zero, and negative Celsius values to ensure that the conversion formula works correctly.

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- Input Mistakes: Ensure that you enter a valid number for the temperature in Celsius.
- Decimal Errors: Check if the program handles decimal values correctly.

**Solutions:**
- Double-check the input for typos or formatting issues.
- Ensure that the program correctly handles decimal input.
