# Code Guide - The Only Guide You Need!

## Introduction
Welcome to the Code Guide for the classic "Hello World" program! This is often the first program that developers write when learning a new programming language. In this guide, we'll break down the code and explain how it works, step by step.

## Problem Description
### Problem Statement
The task is simple: print the message "Hello World" to the standard output.

### Input
There is no specific input for this program.

### Output
The program should print the message "Hello World" to the console.

## About the Problem
### History
The "Hello World" program has a long history and is considered a tradition in the world of programming. It's often used as a first program to demonstrate the basic syntax of a new programming language. The tradition began in the early 1970s when it was used in the first C programming language tutorial by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

### Information and Trivia
- "Hello World" is used as a simple test to ensure that a language or system is correctly installed and configured.
- It has become a symbolic program for new programmers and a way to showcase a programming language's simplicity.
- In some programming languages, printing "Hello World" may require just one line of code, while in others, it may take more.

## Approach
### Implementation
The implementation of the "Hello World" program is straightforward. We will use the `printf` function from the C standard library to print the desired message.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
There is no complex algorithm or data structure involved in this program. It's a basic I/O operation.

## Code Walkthrough
Let's break down the code step by step:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello World\n");
    
    return 0;
}
```

- `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the standard input-output library, which provides functions for reading and writing data.

- `int main() {`: This is the starting point of the program. `main` is the main function where program execution begins.

- `printf("Hello World\n");`: This line uses the `printf` function to print the text "Hello World" followed by a newline character `\n`.

- `return 0;`: This line indicates the successful execution of the program and returns an exit status of 0 to the operating system.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this program is O(1) because it performs a single print operation, which takes a constant amount of time.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also O(1) because the program does not use any data structures that grow with input size.

### Efficiency
This program is highly efficient, as it performs a minimal amount of work to achieve its goal.

## Execution
The execution of the program involves the following steps:
1. The source code is compiled using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
2. The compiler generates machine code or an executable file.
3. The executable file is run, and the "Hello World" message is displayed on the console.

## Examples
- This program can be used as a template when learning a new programming language to ensure that the development environment is correctly set up.
- It can also serve as a starting point for more complex programs, as it demonstrates the basic structure of a program.

## Test Cases
### Test Case 1
Input: None
Expected Output:
```
Hello World
```

### Test Case 2
Input: None
Expected Output:
```
Hello World
```

### Test Case 3
Input: None
Expected Output:
```
Hello World
```

## Troubleshooting
Common issues might include:
- Syntax errors: Make sure the code is correctly typed and all necessary semicolons and brackets are in place.
- Compilation errors: Ensure that you have a C compiler installed and configured properly.
- Execution issues: Check for typos or runtime errors in the code.
