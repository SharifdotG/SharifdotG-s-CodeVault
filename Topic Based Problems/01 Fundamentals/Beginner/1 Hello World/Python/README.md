# Code Guide - The Only Guide You Need!

## Introduction:
Welcome to the Code Guide for the classic "Hello World" program. This simple yet iconic piece of code is often the first step for beginners in programming. In this guide, we will break down the implementation of the "Hello World" program step by step, making it easy for anyone to understand.

## Problem Description:
**Problem:** Display the text "Hello World" on the screen.

**Input:** None

**Output:** "Hello World"

## About the Problem:
### History:
The "Hello World" program is a tradition in the world of computer programming. It dates back to the early days of computing when programmers would use it to test and demonstrate the basic functionality of a programming language or system. The phrase "Hello, World!" was first used in the book "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, which introduced the C programming language.

### Information and Trivias:
- The "Hello World" program is often the first program written by beginners in various programming languages.
- It serves as a simple introduction to a programming environment and helps verify that the necessary tools and configurations are in place.

## Approach:
### Implementation:
To solve this problem, we will use a very straightforward approach:
1. We will write a line of code that prints the text "Hello World" to the standard output.

### Algorithm & Data Structures:
No complex algorithms or data structures are needed for this simple program. We'll rely on the basic output function provided by the programming language.

## Code Walkthrough:
Let's break down the code step by step:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

- We use the `print()` function to display text.
- Inside the parentheses, we provide the text we want to display, which is "Hello World."

## Complexity Analysis:
### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this program is O(1) because it only involves a single print operation, and the time it takes to print a fixed string is constant.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also O(1) because we are not using any data structures that would consume additional memory based on input size.

### Efficiency:
This program is highly efficient as it performs its task in the simplest way possible.

## Execution:
The code execution starts when you run the program. The code is translated from the source code (written in a high-level language like Python) to binary code that the computer can understand. This binary code is then executed by the computer's processor, resulting in the display of "Hello World" on the screen.

## Examples:
The "Hello World" program is often used as an initial test in various programming languages and environments to ensure they are set up correctly.

## Test Cases:
Here are some test cases to validate the code:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: None
  - Expected Output: "Hello World"

## Troubleshooting:
Common issues might include:
- Syntax errors: Ensure that you have correctly typed the code, including capitalization and punctuation.
- Output not displayed: Check if your program is running and if the output is being displayed in the correct place (console, terminal, etc.).
