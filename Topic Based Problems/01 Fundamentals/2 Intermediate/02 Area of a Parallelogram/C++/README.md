# Code Guide - Calculate BMI

## Introduction

This code guide explains how to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) using a C++ program. BMI is a common health metric used to assess whether an individual's weight is within a healthy range based on their height. This code demonstrates a simple implementation to calculate BMI.

## Problem Description

1. **Purpose**: The purpose of this code is to calculate an individual's BMI.
2. **Problem Statement**: Given the weight in kilograms and height in meters of a person, calculate their BMI.
3. **Input**: Two decimal numbers - weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
4. **Output**: The calculated BMI, a single decimal number.

## About the Problem

### History

BMI was first introduced by Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian astronomer, mathematician, and statistician, in the early 19th century. It was originally called the Quetelet Index and was used to assess the degree of obesity of populations. Today, BMI is widely used by healthcare professionals to determine if an individual's weight falls within a healthy range.

### Information and Trivia

- BMI is calculated as weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of height (in meters).
- It is a quick and simple way to assess whether a person has a healthy weight for their height.
- BMI categories typically include underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese.

## Approach

### Implementation

The approach taken in this code is straightforward:
1. Read the weight and height from the user.
2. Calculate the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height).
3. Output the calculated BMI.

### Algorithm & Data Structures

No complex algorithms or data structures are needed for this code. It uses basic arithmetic operations to calculate the BMI.

## Code Walkthrough

Let's break down the code into sections and explain each part step-by-step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    double weight, height;
    cin >> weight >> height;

    double bmi = weight / (height * height);

    cout << bmi << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

1. We include the necessary header file `iostream` for input and output operations.

2. In the `main()` function, we declare two variables `weight` and `height` to store user input. These variables are of type `double` to handle decimal values.

3. We use `cin` to read the weight and height values entered by the user.

4. The BMI is calculated and stored in the variable `bmi` using the formula `weight / (height * height)`.

5. Finally, we use `cout` to display the calculated BMI to the user.

## Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this code is O(1), as it performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations regardless of the input values.

2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(1) because it only uses a few variables to store input and calculate the BMI.

3. **Efficiency**: The code is highly efficient for calculating BMI as it involves basic mathematical operations and has no performance bottlenecks.

## Execution

The code is executed as follows:
1. The user provides input for weight and height.
2. The program calculates the BMI.
3. The calculated BMI is displayed to the user.

## Examples

This code can be used in various scenarios, including:
- Healthcare applications to assess an individual's health status.
- Fitness tracking apps to provide users with insights into their weight and health.
- Medical research for population-level analysis of health trends.

## Test Cases

Here are some test cases to validate the code:

**Test Case 1:**
```
Input:
70.5 1.75
Output:
22.9796
```

**Test Case 2:**
```
Input:
80 1.60
Output:
31.25
```

**Test Case 3:**
```
Input:
65 1.80
Output:
20.0617
```

**Test Case 4:**
```
Input:
55 1.65
Output:
20.202
```

**Test Case 5:**
```
Input:
90 1.70
Output:
31.1419
```

### Troubleshooting

Common issues that users might encounter:
1. Entering non-numeric values for weight or height will result in a runtime error.
2. Negative values for weight or height may produce incorrect results.

To handle these issues, it's essential to add input validation to ensure that the user provides valid numerical inputs.
