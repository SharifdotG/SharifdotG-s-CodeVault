# Code Guide - The Only Guide You Need!

## Introduction
Welcome to the Code Guide for the classic "Hello World" program. This guide will take you on a journey from understanding the problem to diving into the code implementation. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this guide is designed to make you feel at home with code.

## Problem Description
### Purpose
The "Hello World" program is a simple and iconic way to introduce beginners to programming. Its purpose is to display the message "Hello World" on the screen.

### Problem Statement
**Input:** None

**Output:** "Hello World"

## About the Problem
### History
The "Hello World" program has a rich history and is often the first program people write when learning a new programming language. It originated as a simple test program and has since become a symbol of the first step in programming.

### Information and Trivias
- The first recorded use of "Hello, World!" was in a 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum.
- It's traditionally used to demonstrate basic syntax and program structure in various programming languages.

## Approach
### Implementation
The implementation of the "Hello World" program is straightforward. We use a programming language's standard output function to display the message "Hello World" on the screen.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
There is no complex algorithm or data structure involved in this program. It's a basic introduction to syntax and usage of a programming language.

## Code Walkthrough
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```
1. We define a class named `HelloWorld`.
2. Within this class, we have a `main` method, which is the entry point of our program.
3. Inside the `main` method, we use `System.out.println("Hello World");` to print the message "Hello World" to the console.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this program is constant (O(1)) because it always prints "Hello World" in the same amount of time, regardless of input.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also constant (O(1)) because the program doesn't use any additional memory that scales with the input.

### Efficiency
This program is highly efficient as it accomplishes its goal with minimal computational resources.

## Execution
The execution of this program involves several steps, including compiling the source code into bytecode and running it using a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The exact details may vary depending on the programming language used.

## Examples
The "Hello World" program is often used in tutorials and documentation to introduce a programming language. It's a simple yet essential example that helps programmers get started.

## Test Cases
### Test Case 1
**Input:** None
**Expected Output:** "Hello World"

### Test Case 2
**Input:** None
**Expected Output:** "Hello World"

### Test Case 3
**Input:** None
**Expected Output:** "Hello World"

#### Rationale
These test cases cover the basic functionality of the program, ensuring that it correctly prints "Hello World" to the console.

## Troubleshooting
Common issues might include:
- Syntax errors: Ensure you have the correct syntax for your chosen programming language.
- Compilation errors: If you're using a compiled language, make sure to compile the code before running it.
- Environment setup: Ensure that your development environment is properly configured.
