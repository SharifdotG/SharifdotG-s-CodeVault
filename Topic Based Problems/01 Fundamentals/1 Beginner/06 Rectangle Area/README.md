# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description

Welcome to the "Rectangle Area" code hint! In this guide, we will explore a coding problem related to calculating the area of rectangles. Understanding this problem will not only enhance your mathematical and programming skills but also improve your problem-solving abilities.

**Problem Statement:**

You are given two rectangles, represented by their lower-left and upper-right coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2). These coordinates define the positions of the rectangles on a 2D plane. Your task is to calculate the total area covered by the two rectangles.

The total area is the sum of the individual areas of the two rectangles, minus the area of their overlap (if any). You need to return this total area.

**Input:**

- Four integers, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) represent the lower-left and upper-right coordinates of the first rectangle, and (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) represent the lower-left and upper-right coordinates of the second rectangle.

**Output:**

- A single integer representing the total area covered by the two rectangles.

## Example Input and Output

**Example 1:**

Input:
```
x1 = 1, y1 = 1, x2 = 3, y2 = 3
x3 = 2, y3 = 2, x4 = 4, y4 = 4
```

Output:
```
7
```

Explanation: In this example, you have two rectangles. The first one has a lower-left corner at (1, 1) and an upper-right corner at (3, 3). The second one has a lower-left corner at (2, 2) and an upper-right corner at (4, 4). The total area is calculated by adding the individual areas of both rectangles (2x2 = 4 for each) and then subtracting the overlap area (1x1 = 1). So, the result is 4 + 4 - 1 = 7.

**Example 2:**

Input:
```
x1 = -2, y1 = -2, x2 = 2, y2 = 2
x3 = -3, y3 = -3, x4 = 3, y4 = 3
```

Output:
```
24
```

Explanation: In this case, the two rectangles overlap completely, resulting in an overlap area of 4x4 = 16. The total area is the sum of the individual areas of both rectangles (2x2 = 4 for each) minus the overlap, which gives 4 + 4 - 16 = 24.

**Example 3:**

Input:
```
x1 = 1, y1 = 1, x2 = 2, y2 = 2
x3 = 3, y3 = 3, x4 = 4, y4 = 4
```

Output:
```
2
```

Explanation: In this example, the two rectangles do not overlap, so the total area is just the sum of their individual areas, which is 2x2 + 2x2 = 4.

## Constraints

- All input coordinates are integers.
- -10^4 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 ≤ 10^4
- The coordinates of the lower-left corner will not be greater than the coordinates of the upper-right corner for both rectangles.

Now, let's dive deeper into solving this problem step by step.

## Mathematics Used

Before we delve into the solution, let's introduce some mathematical notations to make our explanations more precise.

- Rectangle 1 (R1) has corners: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
- Rectangle 2 (R2) has corners: (x3, y3) and (x4, y4).

We'll use these notations to derive formulas for calculating the total area and the overlapping area of the two rectangles.

## Understand the Problem

To tackle this problem, we need to consider different scenarios based on the relative positions of the two rectangles. We can break it down into three primary cases:

1. **No Overlap:** If the two rectangles don't overlap, we can calculate the total area by simply summing their individual areas.

2. **Partial Overlap:** If the two rectangles partially overlap, we need to calculate the total area by adding the areas of both rectangles and then subtracting the area of the overlap.

3. **Complete Overlap:** If one rectangle is entirely contained within the other, we need to consider only the larger rectangle's area.

Before we write any code, let's explore these cases in more detail and devise a plan to solve them.

## Possible Approaches

### Case 1: No Overlap

In this scenario, the two rectangles don't overlap at all. The total area is simply the sum of the areas of both rectangles.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Total Area (No Overlap) = Area(R1) + Area(R2)

Where Area(R) represents the area of rectangle R.

### Case 2: Partial Overlap

In this case, we have to calculate the total area while considering the area of the overlap. The total area can be calculated as follows:

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Total Area (Partial Overlap) = Area(R1) + Area(R2) - Overlap Area

To find the Overlap Area, we'll need to determine the dimensions of the overlapping region and then calculate its area.

**Mathematical Formulation for Overlap Area:**

Overlap Width = min(x2, x4) - max(x1, x3)

Overlap Height = min(y2, y4) - max(y1, y3)

Overlap Area = Overlap Width * Overlap Height

### Case 3: Complete Overlap

In the scenario where one rectangle is entirely contained within the other, we only need to consider the area of the larger rectangle.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Total Area (Complete Overlap) = max(Area(R1), Area(R2))

Now that we have outlined the three possible cases, let's move on to planning our approach.

## Plan the Approach

Our plan will consist of the following key steps:

1. Determine if the two rectangles have any overlap. To do this, we need to compare the positions of their corners.

2. If there is no overlap (Case 1: No Overlap), calculate the total area by summing the areas of both rectangles.

3. If there is partial or complete overlap (Cases 2 and 3), calculate the total area by taking into account the overlap (if it exists).

4. Return the total area as the result.

Now, let's move on to implementing the algorithm.

## Algorithm

Here's a more structured explanation of the algorithm based on our plan:

1. Check if there is any overlap between the two rectangles.
   - If (x2 < x3) or (x4 < x1) or (y2 < y3) or (y4 < y1), there is

 no overlap. Return the total area as the sum of both rectangles: `return Area(R1) + Area(R2)`.

2. If there is overlap, calculate the overlap area:
   - Overlap Width = `min(x2, x4) - max(x1, x3)`
   - Overlap Height = `min(y2, y4) - max(y1, y3)`
   - Overlap Area = `Overlap Width * Overlap Height`

3. Calculate the total area, considering the overlap:
   - If there is a partial overlap (Case 2: Partial Overlap), calculate the total area as `Area(R1) + Area(R2) - Overlap Area`.

   - If one rectangle is completely contained within the other (Case 3: Complete Overlap), calculate the total area as `max(Area(R1), Area(R2))`.

4. Return the total area as the result.

Now that we have a clear algorithm, let's proceed to create a pseudocode representation of our solution.

## Pseudocode

```plaintext
function calculateTotalArea(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4):
    // Check for overlap
    if x2 < x3 OR x4 < x1 OR y2 < y3 OR y4 < y1:
        // Case 1: No Overlap
        return Area(R1) + Area(R2)
    
    // Calculate overlap area
    Overlap Width = min(x2, x4) - max(x1, x3)
    Overlap Height = min(y2, y4) - max(y1, y3)
    Overlap Area = Overlap Width * Overlap Height

    // Case 2: Partial Overlap
    if Overlap Area > 0:
        return Area(R1) + Area(R2) - Overlap Area

    // Case 3: Complete Overlap
    return max(Area(R1), Area(R2)
```

With this pseudocode, we've effectively described the logic of our solution without tying it to a specific programming language. This pseudocode can serve as a guide to help you implement the solution in your preferred language.

## Test Cases

To ensure our solution works correctly, we should test it with various scenarios, including edge cases. Here are some test cases to consider:

**Test Case 1:** No Overlap

Input:
```
x1 = 1, y1 = 1, x2 = 3, y2 = 3
x3 = 4, y3 = 4, x4 = 5, y4 = 5
```

Expected Output:
```
8
```

Explanation: The two rectangles do not overlap, so the total area is the sum of their individual areas, which is 4 + 4 = 8.

**Test Case 2:** Partial Overlap

Input:
```
x1 = -2, y1 = -2, x2 = 2, y2 = 2
x3 = -3, y3 = -3, x4 = 3, y4 = 3
```

Expected Output:
```
24
```

Explanation: The two rectangles partially overlap, and their total area is 4 + 4 - 16 = 24.

**Test Case 3:** Complete Overlap

Input:
```
x1 = 1, y1 = 1, x2 = 3, y2 = 3
x3 = 2, y3 = 2, x4 = 2, y4 = 2
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

Explanation: The second rectangle is completely contained within the first one, so we consider only the larger rectangle, which has an area of 4.

**Test Case 4:** Negative Coordinates

Input:
```
x1 = -4, y1 = -4, x2 = -2, y2 = -2
x3 = -5, y3 = -5, x4 = -3, y4 = -3
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

Explanation: The two rectangles partially overlap, and their total area is 4 + 4 - 4 = 4.

**Test Case 5:** Overlapping Along One Axis

Input:
```
x1 = 0, y1 = 0, x2 = 4, y2 = 4
x3 = 2, y3 = 2, x4 = 5, y4 = 5
```

Expected Output:
```
13
```

Explanation: The two rectangles overlap along the x-axis, resulting in a total area of 4 + 9 - 4 = 13.

**Test Case 6:** One Rectangle Completely Covers the Other

Input:
```
x1 = 1, y1 = 1, x2 = 3, y2 = 3
x3 = 0, y3 = 0, x4 = 4, y4 = 4
```

Expected Output:
```
16
```

Explanation: One rectangle is entirely contained within the other, so the total area is the area of the larger rectangle, which is 4x4 = 16.

## Troubleshooting

While implementing the solution, you may encounter some common issues. Here are a few troubleshooting tips:

1. **Off-by-One Errors:** Be cautious when calculating the overlap width and height. Ensure you are using the correct inequalities and understand the boundaries of the rectangles.

2. **Corner Cases:** Make sure your code handles cases where one rectangle is entirely contained within the other. This requires correctly identifying which rectangle is larger.

3. **Negative Coordinates:** Test your code with rectangles that have negative coordinates to ensure it handles such cases correctly.

4. **Variable Names:** Use clear and consistent variable names to avoid confusion when implementing the pseudocode in your chosen programming language.

5. **Testing:** Test your code with a variety of test cases to verify its correctness. Include edge cases and scenarios where rectangles don't overlap at all.
