# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description:

You are tasked with creating a program that converts a length measurement from inches to centimeters. The input will be a measurement in inches, and the output should be the equivalent measurement in centimeters.

**Example:**

Input: 10.5 inches
Output: 26.67 centimeters

## Constraints:

- The input measurement will be a positive real number (float).
- The output should be rounded to two decimal places.

## Understand the Problem:

To solve this problem, you need to understand the conversion factor between inches and centimeters. There are 2.54 centimeters in 1 inch. So, you'll need to multiply the input measurement in inches by 2.54 to get the equivalent measurement in centimeters.

## Possible Approaches:

1. **Direct Conversion**: Multiply the input measurement in inches by 2.54 to get the measurement in centimeters.

## Plan the Approach:

The plan here is straightforward: multiply the input measurement in inches by 2.54 to obtain the equivalent measurement in centimeters. This approach doesn't require any complex algorithms or data structures.

## Algorithm:

1. Read the input measurement in inches.
2. Multiply the input measurement by 2.54.
3. Round the result to two decimal places (you can use a function or library for this).

## Pseudocode:

```plaintext
1. Read input_measurement_in_inches
2. Set measurement_in_centimeters = input_measurement_in_inches * 2.54
3. Round measurement_in_centimeters to 2 decimal places
4. Print measurement_in_centimeters
```

## Test Cases:

Let's test our program with various inputs:

1. Input: 0.0 inches
   Expected Output: 0.00 centimeters

2. Input: 12.0 inches
   Expected Output: 30.48 centimeters

3. Input: 5.5 inches
   Expected Output: 13.97 centimeters

4. Input: 100.25 inches
   Expected Output: 254.29 centimeters

## Additional Guidance:

- Ensure you handle the rounding of the result correctly to two decimal places.
- Remember to multiply the input by the conversion factor, which is 2.54, to get centimeters.
- Keep your code clean and readable.
- Consider using a function to perform the conversion, making your code more modular.

Now, try to implement the solution on your own, following the provided plan and pseudocode. Understanding the problem and the logic behind the solution is key to becoming a better programmer. Enjoy coding!
