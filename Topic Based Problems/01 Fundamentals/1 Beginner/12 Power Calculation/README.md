# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description
You are tasked with solving the "Power Calculation" problem. This problem involves calculating the power of a number efficiently. Given a base and an exponent, your goal is to compute the result of raising the base to the specified exponent.

### Input
- You will be given two integers: `base` and `exponent`.

### Output
- You need to return the result of `base` raised to the power of `exponent`.

## Example Input and Output
Let's look at a few examples to understand how this works:

#### Example 1
Input: 
```
base = 2
exponent = 3
```
Output: 
```
8
```
Explanation: 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8

#### Example 2
Input: 
```
base = 5
exponent = 2
```
Output: 
```
25
```
Explanation: 5^2 = 5 * 5 = 25

#### Example 3
Input: 
```
base = 10
exponent = 0
```
Output: 
```
1
```
Explanation: Any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

## Constraints
- The input integers `base` and `exponent` are both within the range of [-1000, 1000].

## Understand the Problem
The problem is simple at first glance: we need to calculate the result of raising a number to a power. However, the challenge lies in doing this efficiently, especially for large exponents. Before diving into the code, let's break down the problem into smaller components.

## Possible Approaches
There are multiple ways to solve this problem, but we'll explore two common approaches:

1. **Brute Force (Naive) Approach:** Multiply the base by itself `exponent` times. This approach is straightforward but not efficient for large exponents.

2. **Optimized Approach:** Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the power. We'll discuss this approach in detail.

## Plan the Approach
We'll use an optimized approach based on the concept of exponentiation by squaring. This approach takes advantage of the binary representation of the exponent to reduce the number of multiplications required.

## Algorithm
1. If `exponent` is 0, return 1 (any number raised to the power of 0 is 1).
2. If `exponent` is 1, return `base`.
3. Initialize a variable `result` to 1.
4. While `exponent` is greater than 0:
   - If `exponent` is odd (i.e., `exponent % 2 == 1`), multiply `result` by `base`.
   - Divide `exponent` by 2 (integer division).
   - Square `base`.
5. Return `result`.

## Pseudocode
```plaintext
Function power(base, exponent):
    If exponent == 0:
        Return 1
    If exponent == 1:
        Return base
    Initialize result to 1
    While exponent > 0:
        If exponent is odd:
            Multiply result by base
        Divide exponent by 2
        Square base
    Return result
```

## Test Cases
Let's consider some test cases to ensure our solution works correctly:

1. Test case with a small exponent:
   - Input: `base = 3`, `exponent = 4`
   - Expected Output: `81`

2. Test case with a negative exponent:
   - Input: `base = 4`, `exponent = -2`
   - Expected Output: `0.0625` (4^(-2) = 1 / 4^2 = 1 / 16 = 0.0625)

3. Test case with a large exponent:
   - Input: `base = 2`, `exponent = 1000`
   - Expected Output: A very large number

4. Test case with zero exponent:
   - Input: `base = 7`, `exponent = 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`

## Additional Guidance
Before jumping into coding, make sure you understand the algorithm. Exponentiation by squaring is an elegant and efficient way to solve this problem.

Now, go ahead, try to implement the solution on your own, and make use of the provided pseudocode and test cases. Understanding the problem-solving process is crucial in programming.
