# Code Guide - Power Calculation

## Introduction
This Code Guide addresses the problem of calculating the power of a given base to a specified exponent. It provides a detailed breakdown of the code implementation to solve this problem.

## Problem Description
**Problem Statement:** Calculate the result of raising a given base to a specified exponent.

**Input:** 
- User inputs a floating-point number for the base.
- User inputs a floating-point number for the exponent.

**Output:** 
- The code calculates and displays the result of raising the base to the exponent as a floating-point number.

## About the Problem
### History
The concept of calculating powers is fundamental in mathematics and has practical applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, and computer science. It is used to model exponential growth, compound interest, and many other phenomena.

### Information and Trivia
- The power operator `**` is commonly used in programming languages to perform exponentiation.
- Exponentiation is the inverse operation of taking the logarithm.

## Approach
### Implementation
The code takes user input for the base and exponent, and then it calculates the result using the power operator `**`. The result is displayed to the user.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
- The algorithm used in this code is simple arithmetic exponentiation.
- There are no complex data structures used in this code.

## Code Walkthrough
Let's break down the code into logical sections:

```python
# User inputs for base and exponent
base = float(input("Enter base: "))
exponent = float(input("Enter exponent: "))

# Calculate the result using exponentiation
result = base ** exponent

# Display the result
print(f"Power of {base:.2f} to the {exponent:.2f} is: {result:.2f}")
```

1. User input: The code prompts the user to enter the base and exponent as floating-point numbers.
2. Calculation: It calculates the result by raising the base to the exponent using the `**` operator.
3. Display: The code then displays the result with two decimal places.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this code is constant, O(1), as the calculations are straightforward and not dependent on the size of the input.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also constant, O(1), as it uses a fixed amount of memory to store the base, exponent, and result.

### Efficiency
The code is highly efficient for calculating powers, and there are no specific areas for optimization.

## Execution
The code is executed in a Python interpreter as follows:
1. The user enters the base and exponent.
2. The code converts the input to floating-point numbers.
3. It performs the exponentiation operation.
4. The result is displayed on the console.

## Examples
This code can be implemented in various scenarios, including:
- Calculating compound interest in finance.
- Modeling population growth in biology.
- Estimating energy consumption in physics.

## Test Cases
Let's provide some test cases to validate the code:
1. **Input:** Base = 2.0, Exponent = 3.0
   **Output:** Power of 2.00 to the 3.00 is: 8.00

2. **Input:** Base = 5.0, Exponent = 0.5
   **Output:** Power of 5.00 to the 0.50 is: 2.24

3. **Input:** Base = 10.0, Exponent = -2.0
   **Output:** Power of 10.00 to the -2.00 is: 0.01

## Troubleshooting
Common issues that users might encounter:
- **Invalid Input:** Users may enter non-numeric values. The code does not handle this and may raise a ValueError.
