7. Display the result to the user.

### Algorithm & Data Structures

There is no complex algorithm involved in this code. It's a straightforward sequence of input, addition, and output. No specific data structures are used apart from basic variables to store the input and result.

## Code Walkthrough

### Explanation

Now let's break down the code into logical sections and explain each part step-by-step:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SumofTwoNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to read input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt the user to enter the first number
        System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
        int firstNumber = scanner.nextInt(); // Read and store the first number

        // Prompt the user to enter the second number
        System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
        int secondNumber = scanner.nextInt(); // Read and store the second number

        // Calculate the sum of the two numbers
        int sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;

        // Display the result to the user
        System.out.println("Sum of " + firstNumber + " and " + secondNumber + " is: " + sum);

        // Close the scanner to release resources
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

Let's dive into each part of the code:

1. We start by importing the `Scanner` class, which is part of Java's standard library and allows us to read input from the console.

2. Inside the `main` method, we create a `Scanner` object named `scanner` to read user input.

3. We use `System.out.print` to display the message "Enter first number: " to prompt the user to input the first number.

4. We then use `scanner.nextInt()` to read an integer from the user's input and store it in the variable `firstNumber`.

5. Similarly, we prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in the variable `secondNumber`.

6. We calculate the sum of `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` by adding them together and store the result in the variable `sum`.

7. Finally, we use `System.out.println` to display the result to the user in the format "Sum of [firstNumber] and [secondNumber] is: [sum]".

8. We close the `scanner` using `scanner.close()` to release any resources it was using.

### Key Insights

- This code is highly interactive as it takes user input and provides immediate feedback by displaying the result.
- The code follows a sequential flow, starting with input, performing a simple calculation, and then displaying the output.
- It utilizes the `Scanner` class for user input, which is a common practice in Java console-based applications.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this code is constant, O(1), because it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size. The time it takes to execute the code is not dependent on the values of `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this code is also constant, O(1), as it uses a fixed amount of memory to store the input values and the result. The memory usage does not scale with the input size.

### Efficiency

In terms of efficiency, this code is highly efficient for the given task. It performs addition, which is a basic arithmetic operation, and the execution time is minimal. There are no unnecessary loops or complex calculations involved.

## Execution

To understand how this code is executed under the hood, let's briefly discuss the steps involved in executing a Java program:

1. **Compilation**: The Java source code is first compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler. The result is a `.class` file containing bytecode instructions.

2. **Loading**: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) loads the compiled bytecode of the program. This bytecode is platform-independent, allowing Java programs to run on various systems.

3. **Verification**: The JVM verifies the bytecode to ensure it adheres to Java's safety and security rules. This step is crucial for preventing malicious code execution.

4. **Execution**: The JVM executes the bytecode line by line. In the case of our program, it starts by executing the `main` method.

5. **Runtime**: During runtime, the JVM manages memory, runs threads, and performs various tasks necessary for the program's execution.

6. **Termination**: The program terminates when the `main` method completes its execution or when an explicit exit command is encountered.

## Examples

The code for calculating the sum of two numbers is a basic building block in programming. It can be applied in various scenarios, including:

1. **Financial Applications**: Calculating the total value of transactions or expenses.
2. **Scientific Calculations**: Combining experimental data or computing statistical sums.
3. **Gaming**: Tracking scores or points in games.
4. **Engineering**: Adding up values in simulations or numerical analysis.

## Test Cases & Explanation

Let's explore some test cases to validate the correctness of the code:

### Test Case 1:

**Input**:
```
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 7
```

**Expected Output**:


```
Sum of 5 and 7 is: 12
```

**Rationale**: In this test case, the code takes `firstNumber` as 5 and `secondNumber` as 7. The sum of 5 and 7 is 12, which is correctly displayed as the output.

### Test Case 2:

**Input**:
```
Enter first number: 0
Enter second number: 0
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Sum of 0 and 0 is: 0
```

**Rationale**: This test case uses both input values as 0. The sum of 0 and 0 is 0, which is correctly displayed as the output.

### Test Case 3:

**Input**:
```
Enter first number: -3
Enter second number: 8
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Sum of -3 and 8 is: 5
```

**Rationale**: In this test case, the code takes `firstNumber` as -3 and `secondNumber` as 8. The sum of -3 and 8 is 5, which is correctly displayed as the output.

### Test Case 4:

**Input**:
```
Enter first number: 1000000
Enter second number: 999999
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Sum of 1000000 and 999999 is: 1999999
```

**Rationale**: This test case uses large input values. The sum of 1000000 and 999999 is 1999999, which is correctly displayed as the output.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues/Errors

1. **Input Mismatch Exception**: If the user enters a non-integer value when prompted for input, such as a string or a floating-point number, an `InputMismatchException` may occur.

2. **Resource Leakage**: Failing to close the `Scanner` using `scanner.close()` can lead to resource leakage.

### Solutions

1. To handle the `InputMismatchException`, you can implement error checking and ask the user to enter valid integer values until valid input is provided.

2. Always close the `Scanner` using `scanner.close()` at the end of the program to release resources properly.
