# Code Guide - Sum of Two Numbers

## Introduction
This Code Guide addresses the problem of finding the sum of two numbers. It provides a detailed explanation of the problem, the approach used to solve it, a walkthrough of the code, complexity analysis, execution details, examples, test cases, troubleshooting, and related resources. The goal is to help readers understand the code thoroughly and provide insights into solving similar problems.

## Problem Description
### Problem Statement
The problem is to calculate the sum of two numbers provided as input.

### Constraints
- The input consists of two integers.
- The integers can be both positive and negative.
- The sum of the two integers will not exceed the integer range.

### Input - Output Structure
**Input**: Two integers, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`, separated by a newline.
```
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: -3
```
**Output**: The sum of the two numbers.
```
Sum of 5 and -3 is: 2
```

## About the Problem
### History
The concept of adding numbers is fundamental and has been used in various fields throughout history. From basic arithmetic calculations to complex scientific research, addition is a fundamental operation.

### Information and Trivia
Adding two numbers is represented mathematically as follows:
$$
\text{Sum} = \text{First Number} + \text{Second Number}
$$

## Approach
### Implementation
The approach to solving this problem is straightforward. We take two integers as input, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`, and then add them together to calculate the sum.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
- Read the first integer, `firstNumber`, from the user.
- Read the second integer, `secondNumber`, from the user.
- Calculate the sum as `firstNumber + secondNumber`.
- Display the result.

## Code Walkthrough
### Explanation
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:
```c
int firstNumber, secondNumber;

// Prompt the user to enter the first number
printf("Enter first number: ");
scanf("%d", &firstNumber);

// Prompt the user to enter the second number
printf("Enter second number: ");
scanf("%d", &secondNumber);

// Calculate the sum of the two numbers and display it
printf("Sum of %d and %d is: %d\n", firstNumber, secondNumber, firstNumber + secondNumber);
```

The code begins by declaring two integer variables, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`. It then prompts the user to enter these two numbers, reads the input, and stores them in their respective variables. Finally, it calculates the sum of these two numbers and displays the result.

### Key Insights
- The use of `printf` and `scanf` functions for input and output.
- The formula `firstNumber + secondNumber` to calculate the sum.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this code is constant, O(1), as it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input values.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also constant, O(1), as it only uses a fixed amount of memory to store the two input numbers and the result.

### Efficiency
This code is highly efficient for calculating the sum of two numbers. It performs the addition in constant time and uses minimal memory.

## Execution
To execute the code, you would typically follow these steps:
1. Compile the C code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC) to generate an executable binary.
2. Run the binary executable, which will interactively prompt you to enter the two numbers.
3. After entering the numbers, the program will display the sum.

## Examples
Here are some examples of scenarios where this code can be implemented:
- Calculating the total score of a player in a game by adding up individual scores.
- Determining the total cost of items in a shopping cart by summing their prices.

## Test Cases & Explanation
### Test Case 1
**Input**:
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 20
```
**Output**:
```
Sum of 10 and 20 is: 30
```
**Rationale**: In this test case, the code takes two positive integers as input and correctly calculates their sum, which is 30.

### Test Case 2
**Input**:
```
Enter first number: -5
Enter second number: 8
```
**Output**:
```
Sum of -5 and 8 is: 3
```
**Rationale**: This test case involves a negative and a positive integer as input. The code correctly computes the sum, which is 3.

### Test Case 3
**Input**:
```
Enter first number: 0
Enter second number: 0
```
**Output**:
```
Sum of 0 and 0 is: 0
```
**Rationale**: In this scenario, both input numbers are zero. The code accurately calculates the sum, which is also zero.

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues/Errors
1. **Incorrect Input**: Ensure that you provide valid integers as input. Non-integer values or characters may cause unexpected behavior.
2. **Memory Issues**: If you encounter memory-related errors, make sure your system has sufficient memory to run the program.

### Solutions
1. To handle incorrect input, you can implement input validation checks to ensure that the user enters valid integers.
2. If memory issues arise, consider closing other memory-intensive programs or processes running on your system.
