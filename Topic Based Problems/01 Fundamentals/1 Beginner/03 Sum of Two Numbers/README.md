# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description

Welcome to the world of coding challenges! In this guide, we'll tackle a simple yet fundamental problem: **Calculating the Sum of Two Numbers**. This is a classic programming task that every coder encounters sooner or later.

**Problem Statement:** You are given two numbers, let's call them `num1` and `num2`. Your task is to write a program that calculates their sum and returns the result.

**Input:** Your program should take two integers as input, `num1` and `num2`. These are the numbers you need to add together.

**Output:** Your program should return a single integer, which is the sum of `num1` and `num2`.

Now that we understand the problem, let's visualize it with some examples.

## Example Input and Output

**Example 1:**

Input: `num1 = 3, num2 = 5`

Output: `8`

**Example 2:**

Input: `num1 = -2, num2 = 7`

Output: `5`

**Example 3:**

Input: `num1 = 0, num2 = 0`

Output: `0`

## Constraints

Before we dive into solving the problem, it's essential to know any constraints that might affect our solution. For this problem, there are no specific constraints on the input values. You can expect integers of any size.

Now that we have a clear understanding of the problem, let's start tackling it step by step.

## Mathematics Used

This problem is quite straightforward and doesn't require any complex mathematical operations. We'll mainly be using basic arithmetic operations:

- Addition (+): We'll add `num1` and `num2` together to get the sum.

Now, let's break down the problem into smaller components and understand what needs to be done.

## Understand the Problem

At its core, this problem is about performing a basic arithmetic operation: addition. We need to take two numbers, `num1` and `num2`, and return their sum. It's a fundamental task, but it's an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving and coding skills.

Before we jump into writing code, let's explore different ways to approach this problem.

## Possible Approaches

### Approach 1: Direct Addition

The most straightforward approach is to directly add `num1` and `num2` together. This is the simplest and most efficient way to solve this problem.

Mathematically, this approach can be represented as:

```python
result = num1 + num2
```

### Approach 2: Bitwise Addition

Another way to perform addition is using bitwise operations. This approach is more complex and not as efficient as direct addition, but it's an interesting alternative.

Mathematically, bitwise addition can be represented as:

```python
carry = num1 & num2  # Calculate the carry
result = num1 ^ num2  # Calculate the result without considering the carry

# Keep adding the carry to the result until there's no carry left
while carry != 0:
    # Shift the carry by one position to the left
    carry = carry << 1
    # Calculate the new result without considering the new carry
    temp_result = result ^ carry
    # Calculate the new carry
    carry = result & carry
    # Update the result
    result = temp_result
```

Please note that this approach is more complex and less efficient, so we'll focus on the first approach (Direct Addition) for our solution.

## Plan the Approach

For this problem, we'll stick with the simplest and most efficient approach, which is **Direct Addition**. Here's the high-level plan for our solution:

1. Take two integers, `num1` and `num2`, as input.
2. Add `num1` and `num2` together.
3. Return the result as the output.

This approach has a time complexity of O(1), which means it's very efficient regardless of the size of the input numbers.

Now, let's formalize this plan into an algorithm.

## Algorithm

1. Start
2. Read `num1` and `num2` as input integers.
3. Calculate the sum of `num1` and `num2`:
   - `result = num1 + num2`
4. Return `result` as the output.
5. Stop

This algorithm is straightforward and follows the plan we discussed earlier. Now, let's move on to pseudocode, which will provide a more detailed representation of the solution's logic.

## Pseudocode

Here's the pseudocode for our solution:

```plaintext
Function CalculateSum(num1, num2)
    // Read input integers
    Read num1
    Read num2

    // Calculate the sum
    result = num1 + num2

    // Return the result
    Return result
End Function
```

The pseudocode outlines the steps we discussed in the algorithm section. It reads two integers as input, adds them together, and returns the result.

Now, let's proceed to test our solution with different cases to ensure its correctness.

## Test Cases

Testing is a crucial part of coding. It helps ensure that your solution works correctly in various scenarios. Let's create some test cases for our problem:

**Test Case 1:**

Input: `num1 = 3, num2 = 5`

Expected Output: `8`

**Test Case 2:**

Input: `num1 = -2, num2 = 7`

Expected Output: `5`

**Test Case 3:**

Input: `num1 = 0, num2 = 0`

Expected Output: `0`

**Test Case 4:**

Input: `num1 = 1000, num2 = 2000`

Expected Output: `3000`

**Test Case 5:**

Input: `num1 = -500, num2 = 500`

Expected Output: `0`

**Test Case 6:**

Input: `num1 = 999999, num2 = 1`

Expected Output: `1000000`

These test cases cover various scenarios, including positive and negative numbers, zero, and large numbers. Make sure your solution can handle these cases correctly.

Now, before we reveal the actual code, let's discuss some common issues or errors you might encounter while implementing this solution and how to troubleshoot them.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue 1: Incorrect Input Handling**

Ensure that your program can handle different types of input, including negative numbers and zero. Test it with various input values to check for any unexpected behavior.

**Issue 2: Overflow**

In some cases, the sum of two large numbers might exceed the limits of the data type you're using. Make sure your solution can handle this gracefully. You might need to use a larger data type or check for overflow conditions.

**Issue 3: Typos or Syntax Errors**

Typographical errors or syntax mistakes can cause your program to fail. Double-check your code for any typos, missing parentheses, or semicolons.

**Issue 4: Incorrect Operator Usage**

Ensure that you're using the addition operator (+) correctly. Using the wrong operator can lead to unexpected results.

**Issue 5: Not Returning the Result**

Make sure your program returns the calculated result as the output. If you forget to return the

 result, your function will not produce the expected output.

Now, you're ready to see the actual code for this problem. But before you do, I want to emphasize the importance of understanding the solution and the problem-solving process.
