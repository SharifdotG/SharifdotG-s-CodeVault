# Code Guide - Kilometers to Miles

## Introduction

This Code Guide addresses the problem of converting a distance in kilometers to miles. It provides a step-by-step breakdown of the code's implementation, explanations of key concepts, test cases, troubleshooting tips, and related resources.

## Problem Description

The problem is to convert a given distance in kilometers to miles. The input is the distance in kilometers, and the output is the equivalent distance in miles.

## About the Problem

### History

The need to convert between different units of measurement, such as kilometers and miles, arises from the diverse systems of measurement used across the world. In this case, the problem is a simple unit conversion, which is commonly encountered in everyday life, especially when dealing with international travel and navigation.

### Information and Trivia

- 1 kilometer is approximately equal to 0.621371 miles.
- This conversion is essential for understanding distances in different countries and regions, as some countries primarily use kilometers, while others use miles.

## Approach

### Implementation

The code uses a straightforward approach to convert kilometers to miles. It multiplies the input distance in kilometers by the conversion factor of approximately 0.621371 to obtain the equivalent distance in miles.

### Algorithm & Data Structures

No complex algorithms or data structures are needed for this task. It's a basic mathematical calculation.

## Code Walkthrough

Let's break down the provided code into sections:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double kilometers;

    printf("Enter the distance in Kilometers: ");
    scanf("%lf", &kilometers);

    printf("Distance in Miles = %.2lf\n", kilometers * 0.621371);

    return 0;
}
```

1. The code starts by including the necessary standard input-output library (`stdio.h`).

2. In the `main` function, it declares a double variable `kilometers` to store the input distance in kilometers.

3. It prompts the user to enter the distance in kilometers using `printf`.

4. The code reads the user's input and stores it in the `kilometers` variable using `scanf`.

5. Finally, it calculates the equivalent distance in miles by multiplying `kilometers` by the conversion factor (0.621371) and prints the result with two decimal places.

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The code has a constant time complexity of O(1) because it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input.

- Space Complexity: The code has a constant space complexity of O(1) as it uses only a few variables.

- Efficiency: The solution is efficient for its purpose, as it directly calculates the conversion without unnecessary steps.

## Execution

The code is executed by compiling it using a C compiler, which translates the source code into machine-readable binary code. This binary code is then executed by the computer's CPU, performing the specified operations.

## Examples

This code can be implemented in various scenarios, such as:

- Travel applications for converting distances between countries that use different units.
- Navigation systems to display distances to users in their preferred units.
- Fitness apps to track and display running or cycling distances in miles or kilometers.

## Test Cases

Here are some test cases to validate the code:

Test Case 1:
- Input: 10.0
- Output: Distance in Miles = 6.21

Test Case 2:
- Input: 42.195
- Output: Distance in Miles = 26.22

Test Case 3:
- Input: 0.0
- Output: Distance in Miles = 0.00

Test Case 4:
- Input: 1000.0
- Output: Distance in Miles = 621.37

### Rationale:
- Test Case 1: 10 kilometers is approximately 6.21 miles.
- Test Case 2: 42.195 kilometers is approximately 26.22 miles (the length of a marathon).
- Test Case 3: A distance of 0 kilometers should result in 0 miles.
- Test Case 4: 1000 kilometers is approximately 621.37 miles.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues or errors users might encounter:

- Input Error: Ensure that the user provides a valid numeric input for kilometers.
- Incorrect Output: Double-check the conversion factor (0.621371) if the output is incorrect.
