# Code Guide - The Only Guide You Need!

## Introduction
This Code Guide addresses the problem of performing basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. It provides a detailed breakdown of the code implementation, the problem description, approach, complexity analysis, execution process, examples, test cases, troubleshooting, and related resources to help you understand and utilize the code effectively.

## Problem Description
The problem involves taking two numbers as input and performing four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The code calculates and displays the results of these operations. 

**Input:**
- Two integers representing the first and second numbers.

**Output:**
- The sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two input numbers.

## About the Problem
### History
Basic arithmetic operations have been a fundamental part of mathematics and computing since their inception. They are used in various real-life scenarios, from simple calculations to complex scientific computations.

### Information and Trivias
- Arithmetic operations are fundamental in mathematics and computer programming.
- They are used in various fields, including finance, engineering, physics, and more.
- Tables and charts can be used to illustrate arithmetic concepts and calculations.

## Approach
### Implementation
1. Take two integer inputs: `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`.
2. Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient using basic arithmetic operations.
3. Display the results using formatted strings.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
- The code uses basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- It utilizes variables to store input and intermediate results.

## Code Walkthrough
```python
firstNumber = int(input("Enter first number: "))
secondNumber = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# Calculate and display the results
print(f"Sum of {firstNumber} and {secondNumber} is: {firstNumber + secondNumber}")
print(f"Difference of {firstNumber} and {secondNumber} is: {firstNumber - secondNumber}")
print(f"Product of {firstNumber} and {secondNumber} is: {firstNumber * secondNumber}")
print(f"Quotient of {firstNumber} and {secondNumber} is: {firstNumber / secondNumber}")
```
- The code takes user input for two numbers.
- It then performs arithmetic operations and displays the results using formatted strings.

### Complexity Analysis
#### Time Complexity
- The code has a time complexity of O(1) as it performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations, regardless of the input size.

#### Space Complexity
- The code has a space complexity of O(1) as it uses a constant amount of memory to store the input and results.

#### Efficiency
- The solution is efficient, with constant time and space complexity for any input.

## Execution
1. The source code is written in Python, a high-level programming language.
2. It is then processed by a Python interpreter, which converts the code into bytecode.
3. The bytecode is executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), producing the desired output.

## Examples
- The code can be implemented in various scenarios, such as:
  - Creating a calculator application.
  - Solving mathematical problems in educational software.
  - Performing basic arithmetic calculations in scientific simulations.

## Test Cases
### Test Case 1:
**Input:**
```
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
```
**Output:**
```
Sum of 5 and 3 is: 8
Difference of 5 and 3 is: 2
Product of 5 and 3 is: 15
Quotient of 5 and 3 is: 1.6666666666666667
```
### Test Case 2:
**Input:**
```
Enter first number: -2
Enter second number: 7
```
**Output:**
```
Sum of -2 and 7 is: 5
Difference of -2 and 7 is: -9
Product of -2 and 7 is: -14
Quotient of -2 and 7 is: -0.2857142857142857
```

## Troubleshooting
1. Ensure that the input values are valid integers to avoid input-related errors.
2. Handle division by zero errors if the second number is zero.
