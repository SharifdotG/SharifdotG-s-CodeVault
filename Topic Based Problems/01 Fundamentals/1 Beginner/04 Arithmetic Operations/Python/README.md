## Problem Description

### Problem Statement

The problem is to perform four arithmetic operations on two input numbers:
1. Addition: Find the sum of the two numbers.
2. Subtraction: Calculate the difference between the two numbers.
3. Multiplication: Compute the product of the two numbers.
4. Division: Find the quotient when the first number is divided by the second number.

### Constraints

There are no specific constraints for this problem. It can handle a wide range of input values as long as they are valid integers or floating-point numbers.

### Input - Output Structure

**Input:**
- Two integers or floating-point numbers: `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`.

**Output:**
- Four lines of output, each containing the result of one of the four arithmetic operations.

## About the Problem

### History

The need for basic arithmetic operations has existed since ancient times when humans first started counting and calculating. These operations are fundamental to mathematics and have been used in various real-life scenarios, from trade and commerce to engineering and science.

### Information and Trivia

Here are some interesting facts about arithmetic operations:
- Arithmetic operations are part of the elementary branch of mathematics.
- The symbols for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) have been in use for centuries.
- Arithmetic is one of the oldest and most essential branches of mathematics, dating back to ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and Babylonians.

### Mathematics Used

Let's define the mathematical notations for each operation:
- **Addition:** If `a` and `b` are two numbers, their sum is denoted as `a + b`.
- **Subtraction:** The difference between `a` and `b` is denoted as `a - b`.
- **Multiplication:** The product of `a` and `b` is represented as `a * b`.
- **Division:** If we want to find the quotient when `a` is divided by `b`, it's written as `a / b`.

## Approach

### Implementation

The code takes two input numbers, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`, and then performs the following arithmetic operations:
1. Addition: `firstNumber + secondNumber`
2. Subtraction: `firstNumber - secondNumber`
3. Multiplication: `firstNumber * secondNumber`
4. Division: `firstNumber / secondNumber`

### Algorithm & Data Structures

There is no complex algorithm involved in this code. It's a straightforward implementation of basic arithmetic operations using Python's built-in operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. No additional data structures are used in this code.

## Code Walkthrough

### Explanation

Let's dive into the code step by step:

```python
firstNumber = int(input("Enter first number: "))
secondNumber = int(input("Enter second number: "))
```

Here, the code starts by taking user input for two numbers, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`. The `int(input(...))` function is used to read integer values from the user.

```python
print(f"Sum of {firstNumber} and {secondNumber} is: {firstNumber + secondNumber}")
```

This line calculates and prints the sum of `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`. It uses string formatting to display the result in a human-readable format.

```python
print(f"Difference of {firstNumber} and {secondNumber} is: {firstNumber - secondNumber}")
```

This line calculates and prints the difference between `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`.

```python
print(f"Product of {firstNumber} and {secondNumber} is: {firstNumber * secondNumber}")
```

This line calculates and prints the product of `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`.

```python
print(f"Quotient of {firstNumber} and {secondNumber} is: {firstNumber / secondNumber}")
```

This line calculates and prints the quotient when `firstNumber` is divided by `secondNumber`.

### Key Insights

- The code uses Python's f-strings for string formatting, making it easy to insert variables into the output string.
- It performs basic arithmetic operations using the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this code is constant (O(1)) because it performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations regardless of the input values.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this code is also constant (O(1)) as it only uses a small amount of memory to store the input numbers and the results of the arithmetic operations.

### Efficiency

The code is highly efficient as it directly uses built-in Python operators for arithmetic operations, which are optimized for performance.

## Execution

The code is executed in the following steps:

1. The user is prompted to enter two numbers.
2. The input values are read and stored in the variables `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`.
3. The code performs the four arithmetic operations and displays the results to the user.

## Examples

Here are some real-life examples where the code for arithmetic operations can be implemented:

1. **Financial Calculations:** Calculate the total cost of items when shopping online, including discounts and taxes.
2. **Engineering Calculations:** Determine the force or torque in mechanical systems by performing arithmetic operations on measurements and constants.
3. **Scientific Research:** Analyze experimental data by applying arithmetic operations to collected measurements.

## Test Cases & Explanation

### Test Cases

Let's test the code with a few sample inputs and explain the expected outputs:

**Test Case 1:**
- Input:
  - `firstNumber = 5`
  - `secondNumber = 3`
- Expected Output:
  - Sum of 5 and 3 is: 8
  - Difference of 5 and 3 is: 2
  - Product of 5 and 3 is: 15
  - Quotient of 5 and 3 is: 1.6666666666666667

**Test Case 2:**
- Input:
  - `firstNumber = 10`
  - `secondNumber = 2`
- Expected Output:
  - Sum of 10 and 2 is: 12
  - Difference of 10 and 2 is: 8
  - Product of 10 and 2 is: 20
  - Quotient of 10 and 2 is: 5.0

**Test Case 3:**
- Input:
  - `firstNumber = -7`
  - `secondNumber = 4`
- Expected Output:
  - Sum of -7 and 4 is: -3
  - Difference of -7 and 4 is: -11
  - Product of -7 and 4 is: -28
  - Quotient of -7 and 4 is: -1.75

### Rationale

- In Test Case 1, the

 code correctly calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of 5 and 3. The quotient is a floating-point number because division results in a non-integer value.
- In Test Case 2, the code performs the arithmetic operations on the inputs 10 and 2, producing the expected results.
- In Test Case 3, negative numbers are used as inputs, and the code handles them appropriately, producing accurate results.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues/Errors

Here are some common issues or errors that users might encounter while using the code:

1. **Non-Numeric Input:** If the user enters non-numeric values when prompted to input numbers, the code will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert them to integers. Users should ensure they enter valid numeric input.

2. **Division by Zero:** If the second number entered by the user is zero, the code will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when attempting to perform division. Users should avoid entering zero as the second number.

### Solutions

To handle these common issues:

1. **Non-Numeric Input:** You can add error handling code to check if the input is numeric before attempting to convert it. If it's not numeric, you can display an error message and ask the user to enter valid numbers.

2. **Division by Zero:** Before performing division, you should check if the second number is zero. If it is, you can display an error message and ask the user to enter a non-zero second number.
