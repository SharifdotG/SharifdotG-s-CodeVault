# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description

Welcome to the world of arithmetic operations! In this coding challenge, you will be tasked with performing various arithmetic operations between two numbers. The goal is to write a program that can take two numbers as input and then perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on them. 

The program should be able to handle both integer and floating-point numbers, and it should provide the results of these operations as accurately as possible.

### Input

Your program will take two numbers as input. These numbers can be integers (whole numbers) or floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points). You can assume that the input will be valid, meaning that there will always be two numbers provided.

### Output

For each of the four arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), your program should produce a result. The output should be in the form of a floating-point number, even if the input numbers are integers. The output should be rounded to a reasonable number of decimal places (e.g., 2 decimal places).

### Example Input and Output

**Input:**

```
Number 1: 5
Number 2: 3
```

**Output:**

```
Addition Result: 8.00
Subtraction Result: 2.00
Multiplication Result: 15.00
Division Result: 1.67
```

### Constraints

- The input numbers will be in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
- For division, the second number (the divisor) will never be zero.

## Mathematics Used

To solve this problem, you'll need to use some basic mathematical operations:

- Addition: The addition of two numbers is represented as `a + b`.
- Subtraction: The subtraction of two numbers is represented as `a - b`.
- Multiplication: The multiplication of two numbers is represented as `a * b`.
- Division: The division of two numbers is represented as `a / b`.

In the case of division, it's important to note that you should handle division by zero gracefully and not allow it to crash your program. You can use mathematical notation to express these operations clearly.

## Understand the Problem

Before diving into the code, let's break down the problem into smaller components and understand what needs to be done.

1. **Input Handling**: You need to read two numbers as input from the user. Ensure that the input is valid (i.e., two numbers are provided).

2. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Addition: Add the two numbers.
   - Subtraction: Subtract the second number from the first.
   - Multiplication: Multiply the two numbers.
   - Division: Divide the first number by the second.

3. **Output Formatting**: Display the results of these operations with the appropriate labels (e.g., "Addition Result: 8.00"). Ensure that the results are presented as floating-point numbers with a fixed number of decimal places.

Now that we understand the problem, let's explore possible approaches to solving it.

## Possible Approaches

There are several ways to approach this problem, but the key is to perform each arithmetic operation separately while handling the input and output gracefully.

### Approach 1: Simple Sequential Calculation

In this approach, you can simply perform each arithmetic operation one after the other, taking care to format the output correctly. This approach is straightforward and easy to implement.

### Approach 2: Function-Based Calculation

Another approach is to create separate functions for each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). You can then call these functions with the input numbers and return the results. This approach makes the code more modular and organized.

### Approach 3: Using a Switch Statement

If you're familiar with switch statements in programming, you can use one to select the arithmetic operation based on user input. This approach can make your code more concise and efficient.

Now that we have these approaches in mind, let's plan our approach for solving the problem.

## Plan the Approach

For this code hint, let's choose Approach 1: Simple Sequential Calculation. We'll start by taking user input, perform each arithmetic operation one by one, and then format and display the results.

### Input Handling

1. Read two numbers from the user. You can use standard input functions or methods depending on your programming language.

2. Check if the input is valid. Ensure that both numbers are provided, and they are valid numeric values.

### Arithmetic Operations

3. Perform each arithmetic operation sequentially:
   - Addition: `result = num1 + num2`
   - Subtraction: `result = num1 - num2`
   - Multiplication: `result = num1 * num2`
   - Division: `result = num1 / num2`

4. Round the result to a reasonable number of decimal places (e.g., 2 decimal places). You can use built-in functions for rounding or implement rounding manually.

### Output Formatting

5. Display the results of each operation with appropriate labels. Ensure that the results are presented as floating-point numbers with fixed decimal places.

Now that we have a clear plan, let's move on to the algorithm.

## Algorithm

Here's the algorithm for solving this problem:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read `num1` and `num2` from the user.

2. **Addition**:
   - Calculate `addition_result` as `num1 + num2`.

3. **Subtraction**:
   - Calculate `subtraction_result` as `num1 - num2`.

4. **Multiplication**:
   - Calculate `multiplication_result` as `num1 * num2`.

5. **Division**:
   - Calculate `division_result` as `num1 / num2`.

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - Display the results with labels in the following format:
     - `Addition Result: <addition_result_formatted>`
     - `Subtraction Result: <subtraction_result_formatted>`
     - `Multiplication Result: <multiplication_result_formatted>`
     - `Division Result: <division_result_formatted>`

   - Ensure that the results are presented as floating-point numbers with a fixed number of decimal places (e.g., 2 decimal places).

Now, let's proceed to write pseudocode for this algorithm.

## Pseudocode

```plaintext
1. Read num1 from the user
2. Read num2 from the user

3. addition_result = num1 + num2
4. subtraction_result = num1 - num2
5. multiplication_result = num1 * num2

6. if num2 is not equal to 0:
     division_result = num1 / num2
   else:
     division_result = "Undefined"  # Handle division by zero gracefully

7. addition_result_formatted = round(addition_result, 2)  # Round to 2 decimal places
8. subtraction_result_formatted = round(subtraction_result, 2)
9. multiplication_result_formatted = round(multiplication_result, 2)
10. division_result_formatted = round(division_result, 2)

11. Display "Addition Result:", addition_result_formatted
12. Display "Subtraction Result:", subtraction_result_formatted
13. Display "Multiplication Result:", multiplication_result_formatted
14. Display "Division Result:", division_result_formatted
```

This pseudocode outlines the complete logic for solving the problem. It reads the input, performs the

 arithmetic operations, handles division by zero gracefully, rounds the results, and formats the output correctly.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues or errors you might encounter and how to handle them:

1. **Input Validation**: Make sure to validate the input to ensure that it's numeric. Handle cases where the user enters non-numeric values gracefully.

2. **Division by Zero**: Handle division by zero by checking if the second number is zero before performing division.

3. **Rounding**: Ensure that you round the results to the correct number of decimal places. Use a round function or method provided by your programming language.

4. **Labeling**: Check that the labels for the results (e.g., "Addition Result:") are correctly formatted and displayed.

5. **Output Format**: Ensure that the output is in the specified format with the correct number of decimal places.

6. **Edge Cases**: Test your program with extreme values, such as very large or very small numbers, to ensure it can handle them.

Remember to follow the pseudocode and algorithm closely to avoid these issues.
