# Code Guide - Arithmetic Operations

## Introduction

Welcome to the Code Guide for "Arithmetic Operations." In this guide, we will explore the implementation of a Java program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers entered by the user. This program serves as a simple calculator, capable of computing the sum, difference, product, and quotient (if the second number is not zero) of two input numbers.

## Problem Description

### Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to create a Java program that takes two integer inputs from the user and performs the following arithmetic operations:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

The program should handle division by zero gracefully and provide an appropriate error message when attempted.

### Constraints

- Input: Two integers
- Output: Arithmetic results (integers for addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and a floating-point number for division)
- Division by zero is not allowed.

### Input - Output Structure

#### Input
- Two integer numbers (firstNumber and secondNumber) entered by the user.

#### Output
- The program will output the following:
  - The sum of the two numbers.
  - The difference between the two numbers.
  - The product of the two numbers.
  - The quotient of the first number divided by the second number, provided the second number is not zero. Otherwise, it will display an error message indicating division by zero.

## About the Problem

### History

Basic arithmetic operations have been fundamental in mathematics and daily life for centuries. They are used for various purposes, from simple calculations in everyday tasks to complex mathematical modeling in fields such as physics, engineering, and finance.

### Information and Trivia

Here is some interesting information about basic arithmetic operations:

#### Addition
Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to find their total. It is represented by the '+' symbol and is commutative, meaning that changing the order of the numbers does not change the result. For example, 2 + 3 = 3 + 2 = 5.

#### Subtraction
Subtraction is the process of finding the difference between two numbers. It is represented by the '-' symbol. Unlike addition, subtraction is not commutative. For example, 5 - 3 = 2, but 3 - 5 = -2.

#### Multiplication
Multiplication is the process of repeated addition. It is represented by the 'x' symbol and is also commutative. For example, 2 x 3 = 3 x 2 = 6.

#### Division
Division is the process of distributing a quantity into equal parts. It is represented by the '/' symbol. Division is not commutative, and division by zero is undefined in mathematics.

### Mathematics Used

The program primarily utilizes elementary arithmetic operations from mathematics, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it incorporates a simple conditional statement to handle division by zero.

## Approach

### Implementation

The approach to solving this problem involves the following steps:
1. Input: The program obtains two integer inputs from the user using a Scanner object.
2. Arithmetic Operations: It performs the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on the input numbers.
3. Output: The program displays the results of these operations, taking into account the possibility of division by zero.

### Algorithm & Data Structures

There is no complex algorithm involved in this program. It uses basic arithmetic operations along with conditional statements for handling division by zero. Here are the key steps:

1. Input: The program uses the `Scanner` class to read user input for the two numbers.
2. Addition: It calculates the sum of the two numbers using the `+` operator.
3. Subtraction: It computes the difference between the two numbers using the `-` operator.
4. Multiplication: It finds the product of the numbers using the `*` operator.
5. Division: It checks if the second number is zero. If not, it calculates the quotient using the `/` operator. If the second number is zero, it displays an error message.
6. Output: The program displays the results of these calculations to the user.

## Code Walkthrough

Now, let's dive into the code and explore how each part is implemented step-by-step.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object for user input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int firstNumber, secondNumber;

        // Prompt the user to enter the first number
        System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
        firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        // Prompt the user to enter the second number
        System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
        secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculate and display the sum of the two numbers
        System.out.println("Sum of " + firstNumber + " and " + secondNumber + " is: " + (firstNumber + secondNumber));

        // Calculate and display the difference between the two numbers
        System.out.println("Difference of " + firstNumber + " and " + secondNumber + " is: " + (firstNumber - secondNumber));

        // Calculate and display the product of the two numbers
        System.out.println("Product of " + firstNumber + " and " + secondNumber + " is: " + (firstNumber * secondNumber));

        // Check if the second number is not zero before performing division
        if (secondNumber != 0) {
            // Calculate and display the quotient of the first number divided by the second number
            System.out.println("Quotient of " + firstNumber + " and " + secondNumber + " is: " + (firstNumber / (double)secondNumber));
        } else {
            // Display an error message for division by zero
            System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero.");
        }

        // Close the Scanner object to release resources
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

#### Step 1: Importing Required Libraries

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

In this step, we import the necessary library, `java.util.Scanner`, which allows us to read user input from the console.

#### Step 2: Main Method

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create a Scanner object for user input
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    int firstNumber, secondNumber;

    // ...
}
```

The `main` method is the entry point of the program. Here, we create a `Scanner` object named `scanner` to facilitate user input. We also declare two integer variables, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`, to store the numbers entered by the user.

#### Step 3: Input - Prompt for First Number

```java
System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();
```

This code segment displays the message "Enter first number: " and then reads the first integer input provided by the user using `scanner.nextInt()`. The entered value is stored in the `firstNumber` variable.

#### Step 4: Input - Prompt for Second Number

```java
System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();
```

Similarly, this code segment prompts the user to enter the second integer, reads the input, and stores it in the `secondNumber` variable.

#### Step 5:

 Addition

```java
System.out.println("Sum of " + firstNumber + " and " + secondNumber + " is: " + (firstNumber + secondNumber));
```

This line calculates the sum of `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` using the `+` operator. It then prints a message indicating the sum along with the values of the numbers.

#### Step 6: Subtraction

```java
System.out.println("Difference of " + firstNumber + " and " + secondNumber + " is: " + (firstNumber - secondNumber));
```

Here, we compute the difference between `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` using the `-` operator and display the result in a similar format as the addition.

#### Step 7: Multiplication

```java
System.out.println("Product of " + firstNumber + " and " + secondNumber + " is: " + (firstNumber * secondNumber));
```

This line calculates the product of `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` using the `*` operator and displays the result accordingly.

#### Step 8: Division

```java
if (secondNumber != 0) {
    System.out.println("Quotient of " + firstNumber + " and " + secondNumber + " is: " + (firstNumber / (double)secondNumber));
} else {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero.");
}
```

This part is slightly more complex. It checks if `secondNumber` is not equal to zero using the conditional statement `if (secondNumber != 0)`. If `secondNumber` is not zero, it calculates the quotient of `firstNumber` divided by `secondNumber` and converts the result to a `double` to ensure that decimal values are included. The result is then displayed.

However, if `secondNumber` is zero, the program displays an error message, "Cannot divide by zero."

#### Step 9: Closing the Scanner

```java
scanner.close();
```

Finally, we close the `Scanner` object to release any resources it might be holding.

### Key Insights

- The program uses a `Scanner` object to read user input, making it interactive.
- It performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Division by zero is handled with a conditional statement.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this program is constant, O(1), because it performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations regardless of the input size. The input size in this case refers to the magnitude of the input numbers, but since they are integers, the number of digits is not a factor.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this program is also constant, O(1), as it only uses a fixed amount of memory to store the integer variables `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`, along with a minimal amount of memory for the `Scanner` object.

### Efficiency

The program is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It can handle input numbers of varying magnitudes without significant performance degradation. However, it is important to note that this program is designed for basic arithmetic operations and is not optimized for very large numbers or complex mathematical calculations.

## Execution

Let's briefly explain how the code is executed from the source code to binary code in the Java programming language:

1. Source Code: The code is written in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and saved with a `.java` extension.

2. Compilation: To convert the human-readable source code into machine-readable binary code, we use the Java Compiler (`javac`). When you run the command `javac ArithmeticOperations.java` in the terminal, it compiles the code into bytecode.

3. Bytecode: Java bytecode is a low-level representation of the code that can be executed on any platform with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

4. Execution: To run the program, you use the `java` command followed by the name of the class containing the `main` method. For example, `java ArithmeticOperations` executes the program.

5. JVM Execution: The Java Virtual Machine interprets the bytecode and executes the program, displaying the output on the console.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues/Errors

Here are some common issues or errors that users might encounter while using the code:

1. **Input Mismatch Exception:** If the user enters a non-integer input when prompted for numbers, the program will throw an `InputMismatchException`. Users should ensure they provide valid integer inputs.

2. **Overflow or Underflow:** The program does not handle integer overflow or underflow. If the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the range of integer values, it may lead to unexpected results.

3. **Floating-Point Precision:** In the division operation, the program converts the result to a `double` to include decimal values. However, floating-point numbers have limited precision, so the result may not be perfectly accurate for certain inputs.

### Solutions

To address these issues:

1. Ensure that the input provided by the user is valid integers. Handle exceptions gracefully by incorporating exception handling using `try-catch` blocks.

2. To handle integer overflow or underflow, consider using larger data types like `long` if necessary, or implement additional checks to prevent overflow or underflow.

3. If higher precision is required, consider using a library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic or rounding the result to a specific number of decimal places.
