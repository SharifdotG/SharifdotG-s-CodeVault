# Code Guide - Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion

## Introduction
This Code Guide will walk you through the implementation of a Python program that converts a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit. It's a simple yet practical problem often encountered in various real-life situations.

## Problem Description
- **Problem**: Convert a temperature in degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit.
- **Input**: Temperature in Celsius as a floating-point number.
- **Output**: Temperature in Fahrenheit as a floating-point number.

## About the Problem
### History
The Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion is a common temperature conversion used in everyday life, especially in countries that use the Fahrenheit scale. It allows people to easily understand and communicate temperature values in different units.

### Information and Trivia
- The Celsius (or Centigrade) scale is based on the freezing point of water at 0째C and the boiling point at 100째C under standard atmospheric conditions.
- The Fahrenheit scale is based on a different set of reference points, with the freezing point of water at 32째F and the boiling point at 212째F.

## Approach
### Implementation
To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, you can use the formula: `Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32`.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
No specific algorithms or data structures are required for this simple conversion. It's a straightforward mathematical operation.

## Code Walkthrough
Let's break down the code step-by-step:

```python
# Take user input for temperature in Celsius
celsius = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))

# Use the conversion formula to calculate Fahrenheit
fahrenheit = celsius * 9 / 5 + 32

# Print the result with two decimal places
print(f"Temperature in Fahrenheit is: {fahrenheit:.2f}")
```

1. User input is taken as a floating-point number for the temperature in Celsius.
2. The formula is applied to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
3. The result is printed with two decimal places.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The code's time complexity is O(1), as it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input value.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1), as it only requires memory for a few variables.

## Execution
The Python code is executed line by line, starting from reading user input to performing the calculation and printing the result. The Python interpreter handles this process.

## Examples
This conversion can be applied in various scenarios:
- Weather apps displaying temperatures in different units.
- Cooking recipes with temperature requirements in Fahrenheit.
- International travel planning with temperature adjustments.

## Test Cases
Here are some test cases to validate the code:

### Test Case 1
**Input**: `Enter temperature in Celsius: 25`
**Output**: `Temperature in Fahrenheit is: 77.00`

### Test Case 2
**Input**: `Enter temperature in Celsius: 0`
**Output**: `Temperature in Fahrenheit is: 32.00`

### Test Case 3
**Input**: `Enter temperature in Celsius: -10`
**Output**: `Temperature in Fahrenheit is: 14.00`

## Troubleshooting
Common issues may include:
- Providing non-numeric input, which will result in a ValueError.
- Check if the formula is applied correctly.
