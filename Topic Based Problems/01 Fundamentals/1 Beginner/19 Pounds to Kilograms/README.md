# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description

You are tasked with writing a program to convert weights from pounds to kilograms. Given a weight in pounds as input, your program should produce the corresponding weight in kilograms as output.

### Example Input and Output

**Input:**
```
Weight in pounds: 150
```

**Output:**
```
Weight in kilograms: 68.18
```

### Constraints

- The weight provided will be a positive real number.

## Understand the Problem

Before we start writing code, let's break down the problem into smaller components and understand what needs to be done.

We are given a weight in pounds and need to convert it to kilograms. The conversion factor is that 1 pound is approximately equal to 0.45359237 kilograms. So, we need to multiply the given weight in pounds by this conversion factor to obtain the weight in kilograms.

## Possible Approaches

There's a straightforward approach to solving this problem:

1. Read the weight in pounds as input.
2. Multiply the weight in pounds by the conversion factor (0.45359237) to get the weight in kilograms.
3. Display the result as the weight in kilograms.

## Plan the Approach

Our plan will consist of the following steps:

1. Accept the weight in pounds as input.
2. Multiply the weight in pounds by the conversion factor (0.45359237).
3. Display the result as the weight in kilograms.

This approach is simple and should work for any valid input.

## Algorithm

Let's formalize the steps in our approach:

1. Read `weight_pounds` as input.
2. Calculate `weight_kilograms` as `weight_pounds * 0.45359237`.
3. Display `weight_kilograms` as output.

## Pseudocode

Here's the pseudocode representation of our algorithm:

```
1. Read weight_pounds
2. weight_kilograms = weight_pounds * 0.45359237
3. Display "Weight in kilograms: " + weight_kilograms
```

## Test Cases

To ensure the correctness of our solution, let's create some test cases:

**Test Case 1:**
Input:
```
Weight in pounds: 150
```
Output:
```
Weight in kilograms: 68.18
```

**Test Case 2:**
Input:
```
Weight in pounds: 200
```
Output:
```
Weight in kilograms: 90.72
```

**Test Case 3:**
Input:
```
Weight in pounds: 50.5
```
Output:
```
Weight in kilograms: 22.92
```

**Test Case 4:**
Input:
```
Weight in pounds: 0.25
```
Output:
```
Weight in kilograms: 0.1133980925
```

**Test Case 5:**
Input:
```
Weight in pounds: 0
```
Output:
```
Weight in kilograms: 0
```

Remember to test edge cases and validate that your program works correctly.

## Additional Guidance

Before jumping into writing code, take a moment to understand the problem and the plan we've outlined. Ensure you have a clear picture of how the conversion works and how to obtain the weight in kilograms from pounds. 

Now, try to implement this solution on your own before looking at any code. It's a simple problem that can help you practice input/output handling and basic mathematical operations.
