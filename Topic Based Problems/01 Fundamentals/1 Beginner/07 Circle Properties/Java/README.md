# Code Guide - Circle Properties

## Introduction
Welcome to the Code Guide for "Circle Properties." In this guide, we will explore a Java program that calculates various properties of a circle, including its diameter, circumference, and area. This code is designed to help you understand how to solve mathematical problems related to circles using Java.

## Problem Description
The problem addressed by this code is to calculate and display the following properties of a circle:
1. Diameter of the circle.
2. Circumference (perimeter) of the circle.
3. Area of the circle.

### Input
The only input required for this program is the radius of the circle, which is provided by the user through standard input.

### Output
The program outputs the calculated values of the diameter, circumference, and area of the circle.

## About the Problem
### History
The properties of circles have been studied for centuries and have applications in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and geometry. The formulas used in this code are based on fundamental principles of geometry.

### Information and Trivias
Here are some key pieces of information and trivia related to circles:
- The diameter of a circle is twice the length of its radius.
- The circumference of a circle is the distance around its boundary and can be calculated using 2πr, where r is the radius.
- The area of a circle is given by πr^2, where r is the radius.

## Approach
### Implementation
The program takes the user's input for the radius and then applies the relevant formulas to calculate the diameter, circumference, and area of the circle. It uses the `Math.PI` constant for the value of π and `Math.pow()` to calculate the square of the radius.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
There is no complex algorithm or data structure involved in this code. It primarily uses basic arithmetic operations and built-in Java functions to perform the calculations.

## Code Walkthrough
Let's break down the code into logical sections and explain each part step-by-step.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CircleProperties {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare a variable to store the radius.
        double radius;

        // Create a Scanner object to read user input.
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt the user to enter the radius.
        System.out.print("Enter radius: ");
        radius = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Calculate and print the diameter of the circle.
        System.out.println("Diameter of circle is: " + (2 * radius));

        // Calculate and print the circumference of the circle.
        System.out.println("Circumference of circle is: " + (2 * Math.PI * radius));

        // Calculate and print the area of the circle.
        System.out.println("Area of circle is: " + (Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2)));

        // Close the Scanner object to release resources.
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

The code begins by importing the `java.util.Scanner` class for input handling. It then declares a `double` variable `radius` to store the user's input. A `Scanner` object `scanner` is created to read user input from the console.

The program prompts the user to enter the radius and then calculates and prints the diameter, circumference, and area of the circle using the formulas mentioned earlier. Finally, it closes the `Scanner` object to release resources.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this code is O(1) because the calculations for diameter, circumference, and area are straightforward mathematical operations that do not depend on the size of the input.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also O(1) because the program only uses a fixed amount of memory to store the `radius` variable and the `Scanner` object.

### Efficiency
The code is highly efficient as it performs all calculations in constant time, making it suitable for real-time calculation of circle properties.

## Execution
The execution of the code involves the following steps:
1. Compilation: The source code is compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler.
2. Loading: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) loads the compiled bytecode.
3. Execution: The `main` method is executed, prompting the user for input and performing calculations.
4. Termination: The program terminates after displaying the results.

## Examples
This code can be used in various scenarios, such as:
- In geometry classes to teach students about circle properties.
- In engineering applications to calculate dimensions of circular objects.
- In graphics programming to draw circles with specific properties.

## Test Cases
Here are some test cases to validate the code:
1. Input: `5.0`
   - Expected Output:
     - Diameter of circle is: 10.0
     - Circumference of circle is: 31.41592653589793
     - Area of circle is: 78.53981633974483

2. Input: `0.0`
   - Expected Output:
     - Diameter of circle is: 0.0
     - Circumference of circle is: 0.0
     - Area of circle is: 0.0

## Troubleshooting
Common issues that users may encounter include:
- Providing non-numeric input for the radius, which will result in a runtime error.
- Incorrectly formatted input leading to unexpected results.

To handle these issues, the code could be enhanced with input validation and error handling.
