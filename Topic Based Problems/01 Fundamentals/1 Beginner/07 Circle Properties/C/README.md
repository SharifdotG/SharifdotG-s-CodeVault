# Code Guide - The Only Guide You Need!

## Introduction

This Code Guide explores the implementation of a C program that calculates various properties of a circle based on its radius. The program calculates the diameter, circumference, and area of a circle, providing a practical application of mathematical concepts.

## Problem Description

The problem addressed by this code is to compute and display the following properties of a circle:
1. Diameter of the circle.
2. Circumference (perimeter) of the circle.
3. Area of the circle.

### Input
The input required is the radius of the circle, which is entered by the user.

### Output
The program displays the calculated values of the diameter, circumference, and area of the circle.

## About the Problem

### History
The concept of calculating the properties of a circle has been fundamental in mathematics and science for centuries. It has practical applications in fields such as engineering, physics, and geometry.

### Information and Trivias
- The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is a constant, denoted by π (pi), which is approximately equal to 3.14159265358979323846.
- The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where "A" is the area and "r" is the radius.

## Approach

### Implementation
The code takes a user-provided radius as input and calculates the desired properties using mathematical formulas. It employs the following formulas:
- Diameter = 2 * radius
- Circumference = 2 * π * radius
- Area = π * radius^2

### Algorithm & Data Structures
No complex algorithms or data structures are used in this code. It primarily relies on mathematical calculations.

## Code Walkthrough

Let's break down the code into logical sections:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
```

The code begins by including necessary header files.

```c
#define M_PI 3.14159265358979323846
```

Here, the constant π (pi) is defined for use in calculations.

```c
int main() {
    double radius;

    printf("Enter radius: ");
    scanf("%lf", &radius);

    printf("Diameter of circle is: %lf\n", 2 * radius);
    printf("Circumference of circle is: %lf\n", 2 * M_PI * radius);
    printf("Area of circle is: %lf\n", M_PI * pow(radius, 2));

    return 0;
}
```

The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It does the following:
- Prompts the user to enter the radius.
- Reads the radius from the user.
- Calculates and prints the diameter, circumference, and area of the circle using the formulas mentioned earlier.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this code is O(1) because the calculations and output generation do not depend on the size of any input data.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also O(1) because the program uses a constant amount of memory to store variables and results.

### Efficiency
The code is highly efficient for its purpose as it directly applies mathematical formulas to compute circle properties. There are no significant areas for improvement.

## Execution

The execution of the code involves the following steps:
1. Compilation: The source code is compiled into machine code using a C compiler.
2. Linking: The compiled code is linked with libraries to create an executable file.
3. Execution: The user runs the executable, which prompts for a radius, performs calculations, and displays the results.

## Examples

This code can be implemented in various scenarios, such as:
- Engineering: Calculating the dimensions of circular objects like gears or wheels.
- Architecture: Determining the size of circular architectural elements.
- Science: Analyzing circular patterns in natural phenomena.

## Test Cases

To validate the code, consider the following test cases:

Test Case 1:
- Input: Radius = 5.0
- Output: 
  - Diameter of circle is: 10.000000
  - Circumference of circle is: 31.415927
  - Area of circle is: 78.539816

Test Case 2:
- Input: Radius = 2.5
- Output: 
  - Diameter of circle is: 5.000000
  - Circumference of circle is: 15.707963
  - Area of circle is: 19.634954

## Troubleshooting

Common issues may include:
- Providing non-numeric input for the radius.
- Not including the necessary header files or defining the constant π.

Solutions:
- Ensure that you enter a valid numeric value for the radius.
- Verify that the code includes the required header files and the π constant is correctly defined.
