# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description

You are tasked with finding the square root of a given number. This problem is about calculating the square root using a numerical method, without relying on built-in functions for square roots.

**Input**: A non-negative real number `x`.

**Output**: The approximate square root of `x` with a specified level of precision.

## Example Input and Output

**Example 1**:
Input: `x = 16`
Output: `4.0`

**Example 2**:
Input: `x = 5`
Output: `2.23607`

**Example 3**:
Input: `x = 0.25`
Output: `0.5`

## Constraints

- `x` is a non-negative real number.
- The precision required for the output, in decimal places, is given as input.

## Understand the Problem

The problem requires you to find an approximation of the square root of a given non-negative real number with a specified level of precision. You cannot use built-in square root functions for this task. Instead, you'll need to implement a numerical method to find the square root.

## Possible Approaches

1. **Newton-Raphson Method**: This mathematical method is commonly used for finding approximations of roots of real-valued functions. It can be adapted to find square roots.

2. **Binary Search**: Although less efficient for finding square roots compared to Newton-Raphson, binary search can also be used as a method to approach the square root.

3. **Exponential Approximation**: This method involves iterative exponentiation and can provide a decent approximation for square roots.

## Plan the Approach

We will use the Newton-Raphson method as our primary approach. This method is efficient in approximating square roots and widely used for this purpose.

### Newton-Raphson Method

1. Start with an initial guess `guess` for the square root.
2. Iterate through the following steps until the desired level of precision is achieved:
   a. Calculate a new guess using the formula: `new_guess = 0.5 * (guess + x / guess)`.
   b. Check if the absolute difference between `new_guess` and `guess` is less than the desired precision. If it is, exit the loop; otherwise, update `guess` with `new_guess`.
3. Return `guess` as the approximate square root.

## Algorithm

1. Input the non-negative real number `x` and the desired precision `precision`.
2. Initialize `guess` to a reasonable starting value, e.g., `guess = x / 2`.
3. Repeat the following steps until the condition in step 2b is met:
   a. Calculate `new_guess = 0.5 * (guess + x / guess)`.
   b. Check if `abs(new_guess - guess) < precision`. If true, exit the loop.
   c. Otherwise, set `guess` to `new_guess`.
4. Return `guess` as the approximate square root.

## Pseudocode

```plaintext
function approximateSquareRoot(x, precision):
    guess = x / 2
    while true:
        new_guess = 0.5 * (guess + x / guess)
        if abs(new_guess - guess) < precision:
            return new_guess
        guess = new_guess
```

## Test Cases

Let's test our solution with a variety of test cases to ensure it works correctly:

**Test Case 1**:
Input: `x = 16`, `precision = 0.0001`
Expected Output: `4.0`

**Test Case 2**:
Input: `x = 5`, `precision = 0.001`
Expected Output: `2.23606`

**Test Case 3**:
Input: `x = 0.25`, `precision = 0.01`
Expected Output: `0.5`

**Test Case 4**:
Input: `x = 9`, `precision = 0.00001`
Expected Output: `3.0`

## Final Remarks

Before looking at the code, it's highly recommended to attempt to solve this problem on your own using the provided plan and algorithm. Understanding how to implement the Newton-Raphson method for square root approximation is a valuable skill in programming and mathematics.
