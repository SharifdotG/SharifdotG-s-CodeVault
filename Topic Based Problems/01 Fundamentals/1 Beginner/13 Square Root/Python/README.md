# Code Guide - Square Root

## Introduction

This Code Guide explores the implementation of a Python program to calculate the square root of a given number. Calculating the square root is a common mathematical operation used in various applications, and this code demonstrates a simple way to perform this calculation.

## Problem Description

The problem addressed by this code is to find the square root of a given number. Specifically:

- **Input**: The user is prompted to enter a number.
- **Output**: The program calculates and prints the square root of the input number.

## About the Problem

### History

The concept of finding square roots dates back to ancient civilizations like the Babylonians and Egyptians, who developed methods for approximating square roots. Over time, various mathematical techniques and algorithms were developed to compute square roots more accurately. Today, square roots are essential in fields like mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.

### Information and Trivia

- The symbol for the square root (âˆš) was first introduced by the ancient Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria.
- The Babylonians had a geometric method for approximating square roots, which involved iteratively refining an initial guess.
- Square roots are used in geometry to calculate the lengths of sides in right triangles.

## Approach

### Implementation

The code uses the `math.sqrt()` function from the Python `math` module to calculate the square root of the user-entered number. This function is a convenient way to perform the calculation without implementing the algorithm from scratch.

### Algorithm & Data Structures

The code does not require a custom algorithm or data structure because it leverages the built-in square root function. However, under the hood, the `math.sqrt()` function likely employs numerical approximation methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method, to compute square roots efficiently.

## Code Walkthrough

Let's break down the code into logical sections and explain each part step-by-step:

```python
import math  # Import the math module

number = float(input("Enter number: "))  # Prompt the user for input
print(f"Square root of {number:.2f} is: {math.sqrt(number):.2f}")  # Calculate and print the square root
```

1. We begin by importing the `math` module, which provides mathematical functions and constants.

2. The code prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function. The entered value is converted to a floating-point number using `float()`.

3. Next, the program calculates the square root of the input number using `math.sqrt(number)`. It then formats the result to display two decimal places and prints it along with a descriptive message.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this code is primarily determined by the `math.sqrt()` function. In practice, this function has a time complexity of O(1) because it performs the square root calculation in constant time.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the code is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of memory to store the input number, intermediate variables, and the result.

### Efficiency

The code is highly efficient for calculating square roots, as it relies on a built-in function that is optimized for accuracy and speed.

## Execution

The execution of the code involves the following steps:
1. The Python interpreter loads the `math` module.
2. It prompts the user to enter a number.
3. The entered number is converted to a floating-point value.
4. The `math.sqrt()` function is called to calculate the square root.
5. The result is formatted and printed to the console.

## Examples

This code can be implemented in various scenarios, such as:
- Calculating the lengths of sides in geometric shapes.
- Performing calculations in scientific research or engineering projects.
- Implementing mathematical operations in computer programs.

## Test Cases

Here are some test cases to validate the code:

**Test Case 1:**
- Input: 9.0
- Output: Square root of 9.00 is: 3.00

**Test Case 2:**
- Input: 2.5
- Output: Square root of 2.50 is: 1.58

**Test Case 3:**
- Input: 0.0
- Output: Square root of 0.00 is: 0.00

**Test Case 4:**
- Input: -16.0
- Output: Invalid input. Square root of a negative number is not defined.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- Issue: Entering non-numeric characters as input.
  Solution: Handle input validation to ensure the user enters a valid number.

- Issue: Trying to calculate the square root of a negative number.
  Solution: Add a check to handle negative inputs and provide an appropriate error message.
