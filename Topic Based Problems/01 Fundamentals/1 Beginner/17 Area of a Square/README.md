# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description
You are tasked with writing a program to calculate the area of a square. Given the length of one side of the square, your program should determine the area of the square.

### Example Input and Output
**Input:**
- Side Length: 5

**Output:**
- Area: 25

**Input:**
- Side Length: 10

**Output:**
- Area: 100

### Constraints
- The side length of the square is a positive integer.

## Understand the Problem
Before jumping into code, let's break down the problem:

1. You are given the length of one side of a square.
2. Your task is to calculate the area of this square.

## Possible Approaches
This problem is straightforward and can be solved in a single step. You just need to multiply the given side length by itself to calculate the area of the square. There is only one approach to solve this problem.

## Plan the Approach
Here's the high-level approach to solving this problem:

- Read the length of one side of the square as input.
- Multiply the side length by itself to calculate the area of the square.
- Print the area as the output.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Read the value of the side length (let's call it `side_length`).
3. Calculate the area by squaring the side length: `area = side_length * side_length`.
4. Print the value of `area` as the result.
5. End.

## Pseudocode
```plaintext
START
    READ side_length
    area = side_length * side_length
    PRINT "Area:", area
END
```

## Test Cases
Now, let's consider some test cases to ensure our solution works correctly:

**Test Case 1:**
- Input: `side_length = 5`
- Expected Output: `Area: 25`

**Test Case 2:**
- Input: `side_length = 10`
- Expected Output: `Area: 100`

**Test Case 3:**
- Input: `side_length = 1`
- Expected Output: `Area: 1`

**Test Case 4:**
- Input: `side_length = 15`
- Expected Output: `Area: 225`

**Test Case 5:**
- Input: `side_length = 0`
- Expected Output: `Area: 0`

## Additional Guidance
- Make sure you handle input validation: check that the side length is a positive integer.
- Remember to prompt the user for input and display the result clearly.
- Don't forget to test your program with different values to ensure it works as expected.

## Final Remarks
Now that you have a clear understanding of the problem and a step-by-step guide, try implementing the solution on your own. This is a simple but essential programming task that will help you build your coding skills.
