# Code Guide - Area of a Square

## Introduction:
This Code Guide explains the implementation of a Java program that calculates the area of a square. It provides a detailed walkthrough of the code, its purpose, and how it solves the problem. The program takes the length of one side of a square as input and computes its area.

## Problem Description:
**Problem Statement:** Calculate the area of a square when given the length of one of its sides.

**Input:** A single real number representing the length of a side of the square.

**Output:** The area of the square, rounded to two decimal places.

## About the Problem:
**History:** The problem of calculating the area of a square is a fundamental mathematical concept. It has practical applications in various fields such as geometry, engineering, and computer graphics.

**Information and Trivia:** The area of a square can be computed by multiplying the length of one of its sides by itself (side * side). The formula is straightforward and widely used.

## Approach:
**Implementation:** The code takes user input for the length of a side and uses a simple formula to calculate the area of the square. It then prints the result to the console.

**Algorithm & Data Structures:** There is no complex algorithm or data structure involved in this program. It's a straightforward calculation using basic arithmetic.

## Code Walkthrough:
The code can be divided into several sections:

1. **Importing Libraries:** The code begins by importing the `Scanner` class, which is used for user input.

2. **Main Method:** The `main` method is the entry point of the program. It initializes a `Scanner` object to read user input.

3. **Input:** The code prompts the user to enter the length of a side of the square and stores it in the `side` variable.

4. **Calculation:** It calculates the area of the square by squaring the value of `side` (side * side).

5. **Output:** The program prints the calculated area to the console, formatted to two decimal places.

6. **Closing Scanner:** Finally, the `Scanner` is closed to release system resources.

## Complexity Analysis:
**Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this program is O(1) because it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of memory to store the `side` variable.

**Efficiency:** This code is highly efficient for calculating the area of a square as it involves basic arithmetic operations and has no significant performance bottlenecks.

## Execution:
The code execution follows these steps:
1. Compilation: The Java source code is compiled into bytecode.
2. Loading: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) loads the bytecode.
3. Verification: The JVM verifies the bytecode for security and correctness.
4. Execution: The `main` method is executed, and user input is processed.
5. Output: The result is printed to the console.

## Examples:
This code can be used in various scenarios where the area of a square needs to be calculated. For example, in a geometry application, architectural design software, or even in educational tools.

## Test Cases:
Here are some test cases to validate the code:

1. **Input:** `5.0`
   **Output:** `Area of a Square = 25.00`

2. **Input:** `10.5`
   **Output:** `Area of a Square = 110.25`

3. **Input:** `0.1`
   **Output:** `Area of a Square = 0.01`

## Troubleshooting:
- Ensure that you enter a valid positive number for the side length.
- Watch out for typos or syntax errors in the code.
