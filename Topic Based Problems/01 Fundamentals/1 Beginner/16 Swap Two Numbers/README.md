# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description

You're tasked with swapping the values of two numbers without using any additional variables. In other words, given two numbers A and B, you need to exchange their values in such a way that A becomes B, and B becomes A.

**Input**: Two integers, A and B.

**Output**: The same integers with their values swapped.

## Example Input and Output

**Example 1:**

Input: A = 5, B = 8

Output: A = 8, B = 5

**Example 2:**

Input: A = -3, B = 2

Output: A = 2, B = -3

## Constraints

- The values of A and B can range from -1000 to 1000.

## Understand the Problem

Before jumping into code, let's break down the problem into smaller components.

1. You have two variables, A and B, holding integer values.
2. Your task is to swap the values of these two variables.
3. The catch is that you cannot use any additional variables.

## Possible Approaches

There are a few ways to solve this problem:

1. **Using Arithmetic Operations**: You can swap the values of A and B using simple arithmetic operations. This involves addition and subtraction.

2. **Using Bit Manipulation**: You can also swap values using bit manipulation, specifically XOR (^) operation.

3. **Using Tuple Unpacking (Python Specific)**: If you're using Python, you can use tuple unpacking to swap values elegantly.

Now, let's plan our approach.

## Plan the Approach

We will go with the first approach, using arithmetic operations. It's simple and works for any programming language.

## Algorithm

Here's the algorithm for swapping A and B using arithmetic operations:

1. Add A and B and store the result in A. (A = A + B)
2. Subtract the new A from B and store the result in B. (B = A - B)
3. Subtract the new B from A and store the result in A. (A = A - B)

This way, the values of A and B will be swapped without the use of any additional variables.

## Pseudocode

Here's the pseudocode for our algorithm:

```
swapNumbers(A, B):
    A = A + B
    B = A - B
    A = A - B
```

## Test Cases

Now, let's test our solution with some cases:

**Test Case 1:**

Input: A = 5, B = 8

Expected Output: A = 8, B = 5

**Test Case 2:**

Input: A = -3, B = 2

Expected Output: A = 2, B = -3

**Test Case 3:**

Input: A = 0, B = 1000

Expected Output: A = 1000, B = 0

**Test Case 4:**

Input: A = -500, B = -1000

Expected Output: A = -1000, B = -500

## Additional Guidance

- Understand the problem thoroughly before starting to code.
- Carefully implement the arithmetic operations; small mistakes can lead to incorrect results.
- Try to solve the problem on your own before checking the code.
