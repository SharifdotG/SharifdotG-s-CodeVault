# Code Guide - Calculate Percentage

## Introduction:
This Code Guide will walk you through the implementation of a Python script that calculates the percentage of one number in relation to another. It's a simple yet useful program that can be applied in various scenarios where percentage calculations are needed.

## Problem Description:
The problem this code addresses is calculating the percentage of one number in relation to another. Given a specific number and a total number, the code computes and displays the percentage of the given number with respect to the total number.

### Input:
- The user is prompted to enter two values: the specific number (`number`) and the total number (`total_number`).

### Output:
- The code outputs the percentage of the specific number in relation to the total number, formatted with two decimal places.

## About the Problem:
### History:
The concept of calculating percentages is widely used in everyday life, such as in finance, education, and statistics. It dates back to ancient civilizations where people needed to calculate portions of a whole.

### Information and Trivia:
- Percentages are often represented using the '%' symbol.
- In some cultures, percentages are referred to as "out of a hundred" due to the base 100 representation.
- Percentage calculations are foundational in fields like business, science, and economics.

## Approach:
### Implementation:
The code takes a straightforward approach to solving the problem:
1. It accepts user input for the specific number and the total number.
2. It calculates the percentage by dividing the specific number by the total number and multiplying the result by 100.
3. Finally, it formats and displays the result with two decimal places.

### Algorithm & Data Structures:
- This code does not require complex algorithms or data structures. It relies on basic arithmetic operations and string formatting.

## Code Walkthrough:
```python
number = float(input("Enter number: "))      # Accept user input for the specific number
total_number = float(input("Enter total number: "))  # Accept user input for the total number

# Calculate the percentage and display it with two decimal places
print(f"Percentage of {number:.2f} is: {number / total_number * 100:.2f}%")
```

- The code starts by prompting the user to input the specific number and total number.
- It then calculates the percentage using a simple formula: `(number / total_number) * 100`.
- The `f-string` is used to format the output with two decimal places.

## Complexity Analysis:
### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this code is O(1), as it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input values.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is also O(1), as the code uses a constant amount of memory for storing the input values and the result.

### Efficiency:
- This solution is efficient for its purpose, as it directly computes the percentage without unnecessary computations.

## Execution:
The code is executed by reading and interpreting the Python source code, compiling it into bytecode, and then executing the bytecode on the Python interpreter. The input values provided by the user are processed by the script, and the result is displayed on the console.

## Examples:
This code can be applied in various scenarios, such as:
- Calculating the percentage increase or decrease in stock prices.
- Determining the percentage of correct answers in a quiz.
- Calculating the discount percentage on a product.

## Test Cases:
Here are some test cases to validate the code:

1. **Input:** 
   - Specific number (`number`) = 25
   - Total number (`total_number`) = 100
   - **Expected Output:** Percentage of 25.00 is: 25.00%

2. **Input:** 
   - Specific number (`number`) = 8
   - Total number (`total_number`) = 40
   - **Expected Output:** Percentage of 8.00 is: 20.00%

3. **Input:** 
   - Specific number (`number`) = 3.5
   - Total number (`total_number`) = 7
   - **Expected Output:** Percentage of 3.50 is: 50.00%

## Troubleshooting:
Common issues you might encounter:
- **ValueError:** Ensure that you provide valid numeric input. The code expects floating-point numbers.
- **Division by Zero:** If the total number is zero, it will result in a division by zero error. Ensure the total number is not zero.
