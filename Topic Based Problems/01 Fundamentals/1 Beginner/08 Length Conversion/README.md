# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description:
You are tasked with writing a program that converts lengths from one unit to another. The goal is to take an input length in one unit and convert it to another unit based on a provided conversion factor. Your program should be able to handle various length conversion scenarios.

## Example Input and Output:
**Example 1:**
Input:
- Length: 5.0
- From Unit: Meters
- To Unit: Centimeters

Output:
- Converted Length: 500.0

**Example 2:**
Input:
- Length: 2.5
- From Unit: Feet
- To Unit: Yards

Output:
- Converted Length: 0.83333

**Example 3:**
Input:
- Length: 1000.0
- From Unit: Kilometers
- To Unit: Miles

Output:
- Converted Length: 0.621371

## Constraints:
- Lengths are real numbers (floats) with up to 2 decimal places.
- The input length will always be non-negative.
- Conversion factors will be provided as real numbers (floats) with up to 5 decimal places.
- You need to handle various units of length such as meters, centimeters, feet, yards, kilometers, miles, etc.

## Understand the Problem:
The problem is about creating a program that converts lengths from one unit to another using given conversion factors. We need to take the input length in one unit and convert it to the desired unit, considering the provided conversion factor.

## Possible Approaches:
1. **Direct Conversion:** Multiply the input length by the conversion factor to get the converted length.
2. **Two-Step Conversion:** Convert the input length to a common unit (e.g., meters) first, then convert it to the desired unit.

## Plan the Approach:
We can use the "Direct Conversion" approach for simplicity. For each input, we will multiply it by the provided conversion factor to get the converted length.

## Algorithm:
1. Accept input values: Length, From Unit, To Unit, and Conversion Factor.
2. Check if the From Unit is the same as the To Unit. If they are the same, return the input length as the converted length (no conversion needed).
3. If the units are different, multiply the input length by the conversion factor to get the converted length.
4. Return the converted length.

## Pseudocode:
```plaintext
function convertLength(length, fromUnit, toUnit, conversionFactor):
    if fromUnit == toUnit:
        return length
    else:
        convertedLength = length * conversionFactor
        return convertedLength

length = inputLength
fromUnit = inputFromUnit
toUnit = inputToUnit
conversionFactor = getConversionFactor(fromUnit, toUnit)
result = convertLength(length, fromUnit, toUnit, conversionFactor)
print(result)
```

## Test Cases:
Here are some test cases to validate your solution:

**Test Case 1:**
- Length: 5.0
- From Unit: Meters
- To Unit: Centimeters
- Conversion Factor: 100.0 (1 meter = 100 centimeters)
- Expected Output: 500.0

**Test Case 2:**
- Length: 2.5
- From Unit: Feet
- To Unit: Yards
- Conversion Factor: 0.33333 (1 foot = 0.33333 yards)
- Expected Output: 0.83333

**Test Case 3:**
- Length: 1000.0
- From Unit: Kilometers
- To Unit: Miles
- Conversion Factor: 0.621371 (1 kilometer = 0.621371 miles)
- Expected Output: 0.621371

**Test Case 4:**
- Length: 10.0
- From Unit: Inches
- To Unit: Millimeters
- Conversion Factor: 25.4 (1 inch = 25.4 millimeters)
- Expected Output: 254.0

**Test Case 5:**
- Length: 0.0
- From Unit: Meters
- To Unit: Meters
- Conversion Factor: 1.0
- Expected Output: 0.0

Ensure that your code handles these test cases correctly and produces the expected results.

## Final Remarks:
Before checking the code solution, it's essential to understand the problem thoroughly and plan your approach. Make sure you implement the logic according to the provided pseudocode. Understanding the conversion factors between different units is crucial for solving this problem. Good luck, and happy coding!
