# Code Guide - Triangle Angle

## Introduction

This Code Guide will walk you through the implementation of a Java program called "Triangle Angle." The purpose of this program is to calculate the third angle of a triangle when two of its angles are provided by the user. It is a simple mathematical problem that can be solved using basic arithmetic operations.

## Problem Description

In this problem, we aim to find the measure of the third angle of a triangle given the measures of the other two angles. The problem can be summarized as follows:

**Problem Statement:** Given two angles of a triangle, find the measure of the third angle.

**Input:** Two integer values representing the measures of the first and second angles.

**Output:** The measure of the third angle.

## About the Problem

### History

The problem of finding the angles of a triangle has been a fundamental concept in geometry for centuries. It has applications in various fields, including engineering, architecture, and physics. Understanding the relationships between the angles of a triangle is essential for solving complex geometric problems.

### Information and Trivia

- The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.
- Triangles can be classified into different types based on their angles, such as acute, obtuse, and right triangles.
- The concept of triangle angles is foundational in trigonometry, which plays a crucial role in mathematics and science.

## Approach

### Implementation

The approach to solving this problem is straightforward. We know that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, to find the measure of the third angle, we subtract the sum of the given two angles from 180.

### Algorithm & Data Structures

No complex algorithms or data structures are needed for this problem. It primarily involves basic arithmetic operations.

## Code Walkthrough

Let's break down the code into logical sections and explain each part step-by-step:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TriangleAngle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int firstAngle, secondAngle, thirdAngle;

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter first angle: ");
        firstAngle = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter second angle: ");
        secondAngle = scanner.nextInt();

        thirdAngle = 180 - (firstAngle + secondAngle);

        System.out.println("Third angle is: " + thirdAngle);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

1. We start by importing the `Scanner` class to take user input.

2. We declare three integer variables: `firstAngle`, `secondAngle`, and `thirdAngle`. `firstAngle` and `secondAngle` will store the user-provided angles, and `thirdAngle` will store the calculated result.

3. We create an instance of the `Scanner` class to read user input.

4. We prompt the user to enter the first angle and store it in the `firstAngle` variable.

5. Similarly, we prompt the user to enter the second angle and store it in the `secondAngle` variable.

6. We calculate the measure of the third angle using the formula: `thirdAngle = 180 - (firstAngle + secondAngle)`.

7. Finally, we display the result to the user using `System.out.println`.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this code is O(1) because it performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations regardless of the input values.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1) as well since it only uses a few integer variables to store values, and the memory usage does not depend on the input size.

### Efficiency

The solution is highly efficient, as it solves the problem in constant time and space complexity.

## Execution

The code execution process involves compiling the Java source code into bytecode and then executing it using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This process is handled by the Java development environment and is transparent to the user.

## Examples

This code can be implemented in various scenarios, such as:

- Calculating the third angle of a triangle in a geometry class.
- Building applications related to trigonometry or geometry.

## Test Cases

Let's include some test cases to validate the code:

**Test Case 1:**
- Input:
  - First Angle: 45 degrees
  - Second Angle: 60 degrees
- Expected Output:
  - Third angle is: 75 degrees
- Explanation: The sum of the given angles (45 + 60) is 105 degrees. Therefore, the third angle is 180 - 105 = 75 degrees.

**Test Case 2:**
- Input:
  - First Angle: 90 degrees
  - Second Angle: 45 degrees
- Expected Output:
  - Third angle is: 45 degrees
- Explanation: The sum of the given angles (90 + 45) is 135 degrees. Therefore, the third angle is 180 - 135 = 45 degrees.

**Test Case 3:**
- Input:
  - First Angle: 30 degrees
  - Second Angle: 120 degrees
- Expected Output:
  - Third angle is: 30 degrees
- Explanation: The sum of the given angles (30 + 120) is 150 degrees. Therefore, the third angle is 180 - 150 = 30 degrees.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues or errors that users might encounter include:
- Entering non-integer values for angles (e.g., decimals or text). The code expects integer inputs, so it will throw an exception if non-integer values are provided.

To handle these issues, you can add input validation code to ensure that only valid integer values are accepted as input.
