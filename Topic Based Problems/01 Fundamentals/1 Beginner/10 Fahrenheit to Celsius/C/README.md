# Code Guide - Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion

## Introduction
This Code Guide explains the implementation of a simple C program that converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Temperature conversion is a common task in various fields, including meteorology, cooking, and engineering. This program provides a straightforward solution to this problem.

## Problem Description
The problem is to convert a temperature given in Fahrenheit to its equivalent in Celsius. The input is the temperature in Fahrenheit, and the output is the temperature in Celsius.

### Input
- Temperature in Fahrenheit (a real number).

### Output
- Temperature in Celsius (a real number).

## About the Problem

### History
The need to convert between temperature scales arises from the differences in measurement systems used worldwide. The Fahrenheit scale is mainly used in the United States, while the Celsius scale (also known as the Centigrade scale) is the standard in most other countries. Converting between these scales is essential for international communication and scientific research.

### Information and Trivia
- The Fahrenheit scale was invented by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in the early 18th century.
- The Celsius scale was developed by Anders Celsius in the mid-18th century.
- The freezing point of water on the Fahrenheit scale is 32°F, while on the Celsius scale, it's 0°C.
- The boiling point of water on the Fahrenheit scale is 212°F, while on the Celsius scale, it's 100°C.

## Approach

### Implementation
The program uses a simple formula to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius:

```c
Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
```

### Algorithm & Data Structures
No complex algorithms or data structures are required for this problem. The program relies on basic arithmetic operations and variables to perform the conversion.

## Code Walkthrough

### Input
- The program starts by declaring a variable `fahrenheit` to store the input temperature in Fahrenheit.
- It then uses the `printf` and `scanf` functions to prompt the user for input and read the value into the `fahrenheit` variable.

```c
double fahrenheit;
printf("Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: ");
scanf("%lf", &fahrenheit);
```

### Temperature Conversion
- The program calculates the temperature in Celsius using the provided formula.
- It subtracts 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature, multiplies the result by 5, and divides by 9.
- The result is stored in the `celsius` variable.

```c
double celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
```

### Output
- Finally, the program displays the temperature in Celsius with two decimal places using the `printf` function.

```c
printf("Temperature in Celsius is: %.2lf\n", celsius);
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this program is constant (O(1)) because it performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations regardless of the input value.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is also constant (O(1)) because it uses a fixed amount of memory to store variables, irrespective of the input size.

### Efficiency
- The solution is highly efficient for converting individual temperatures. However, for bulk conversions, it may be more efficient to process them in batches to reduce function call overhead.

## Execution

### Binary Code Generation
- The C code is compiled using a C compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).
- The compiler generates binary code that can be executed on the target system.

## Examples

### Real-Life Applications
- This code can be used in weather forecasting applications to convert temperature readings from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
- It's also useful in cooking and baking, where some recipes provide temperatures in Fahrenheit, but you prefer using Celsius.

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1
- Input: 98.6
- Output: Temperature in Celsius is: 37.00

### Test Case 2
- Input: 32
- Output: Temperature in Celsius is: 0.00

### Test Case 3
- Input: -40
- Output: Temperature in Celsius is: -40.00

### Rationale
- Test Case 1 verifies a typical body temperature conversion.
- Test Case 2 checks the freezing point of water.
- Test Case 3 tests the equality of both scales at -40°.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Incorrect input type: Ensure you enter a real number (e.g., 98.6) for the temperature.
- Incorrect formula: Double-check that the formula `(Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9` is correctly implemented.

### Solutions
- Verify the input data type and ensure it matches the expected format.
- Review the code to ensure the formula is correctly implemented with proper parentheses and arithmetic operations.
