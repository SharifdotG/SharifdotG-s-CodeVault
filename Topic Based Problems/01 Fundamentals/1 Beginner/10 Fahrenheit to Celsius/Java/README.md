# Code Guide - Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion

## Introduction
This Code Guide will walk you through the implementation of a Java program that converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius. It's a simple yet essential utility, often used in weather applications and everyday temperature conversions.

## Problem Description
The problem is to convert a temperature in Fahrenheit to its equivalent in Celsius. The formula for this conversion is: 

Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9

### Input
- Temperature in Fahrenheit (user input)

### Output
- Temperature in Celsius

## About the Problem
### History
The Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics and meteorology. It was introduced by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in the early 18th century and is still widely used in the United States. However, most of the world uses the Celsius scale for temperature measurements, making this conversion crucial for global communication.

### Information and Trivia
- Fahrenheit and Celsius are two of the most common temperature scales globally.
- The Fahrenheit scale was initially based on the freezing and boiling points of brine, a solution of salt and water.
- Absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature, is -459.67°F or -273.15°C.

## Approach
### Implementation
The approach to solving this problem is straightforward: we take the temperature in Fahrenheit as input, apply the conversion formula, and then display the result in Celsius.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
There is no complex algorithm or data structure involved. We use basic mathematical operations to perform the conversion.

## Code Walkthrough
Let's break down the code into logical sections and explain each part step-by-step.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FahrenheittoCelsius {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double fahrenheit;

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: ");
        fahrenheit = scanner.nextDouble();
        scanner.close();

        System.out.printf("Temperature in Celsius is: %.2f\n", (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9);
    }
}
```

1. We start by importing the `Scanner` class for user input.
2. In the `main` method, we declare a variable `fahrenheit` to store the temperature in Fahrenheit.
3. We create a `Scanner` object to read user input.
4. The user is prompted to enter a temperature in Fahrenheit.
5. The entered value is stored in the `fahrenheit` variable.
6. We close the `Scanner` object to release resources.
7. Finally, we use `printf` to display the temperature in Celsius with two decimal places using the conversion formula.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this code is O(1) because it performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations regardless of the input size.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also O(1) as it uses a constant amount of memory to store the input and intermediate variables.

### Efficiency
This code is highly efficient as it directly applies the conversion formula without any unnecessary computations.

## Execution
The code is executed as follows:
1. The Java source code is compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler.
2. The bytecode is interpreted and executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Examples
This code can be implemented in various applications, such as weather apps, temperature monitoring systems, and cooking temperature conversion tools.

## Test Cases
Here are some test cases to validate the code:

1. Input: 32°F
   Output: Temperature in Celsius is: 0.00

2. Input: 100°F
   Output: Temperature in Celsius is: 37.78

3. Input: -40°F
   Output: Temperature in Celsius is: -40.00

## Troubleshooting
Common issues might include:
- Input validation (ensuring the input is a valid number).
- Handling non-numeric input.
- Dealing with rounding errors in floating-point calculations.

To address these issues, you can implement additional error handling and input validation in your code.
