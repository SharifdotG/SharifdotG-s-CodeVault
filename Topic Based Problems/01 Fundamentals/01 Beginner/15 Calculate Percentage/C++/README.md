# Code Guide - Calculate Percentage

## Introduction:
This Code Guide will walk you through the implementation of a C++ program designed to calculate the percentage of a given number relative to a total number. This program is a simple mathematical utility and serves as an excellent example for beginners to understand basic input/output operations and mathematical calculations in C++.

## Problem Description:
The problem this code addresses is to calculate the percentage of a given number in relation to a total number. The user is prompted to enter two values: the 'number' and the 'totalNumber.' The program then calculates the percentage and displays the result. 

**Input:**
- `number`: The value for which you want to calculate the percentage.
- `totalNumber`: The total value against which you want to calculate the percentage.

**Output:**
- The program outputs the percentage of 'number' with respect to 'totalNumber' as a floating-point number with two decimal places followed by a percentage sign.

## About the Problem:

### History:
The concept of calculating percentages is commonly used in various fields, including finance, mathematics, and statistics. It finds applications in budgeting, data analysis, and many other real-life scenarios where relative proportions are important.

### Information and Trivia:
- Percentages are often represented as decimals when used in mathematical calculations, such as 0.5 for 50%.
- In some countries, sales tax or value-added tax (VAT) is expressed as a percentage, influencing the final price of goods and services.
- Percentages are essential for understanding demographic data, such as population growth rates or employment statistics.

## Approach:

### Implementation:
The program takes two input values, 'number' and 'totalNumber,' and calculates the percentage using a simple mathematical formula:

```
Percentage = (number / totalNumber) * 100
```

### Algorithm & Data Structures:
No complex algorithms or data structures are used in this program. It employs basic arithmetic operations.

## Code Walkthrough:

### Input:
- The program starts by declaring two variables, 'number' and 'totalNumber,' to store user inputs.
- It then prompts the user to enter 'number' and 'totalNumber' using `cin`.

### Calculation:
- The percentage is calculated using the formula mentioned above.
- The result is formatted to display two decimal places using `fixed` and `setprecision(2)` from the `<iomanip>` library.
- The percentage sign '%' is added to the output.

### Output:
- The program displays the calculated percentage.

### Complexity Analysis:

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this program is O(1) because it performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations regardless of the input values.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as well since it only uses a fixed amount of memory to store the input values and the result.

#### Efficiency:
This solution is highly efficient and straightforward, suitable for small-scale percentage calculations.

## Execution:

1. The source code is written in C++.
2. The C++ compiler translates the source code into an intermediate representation.
3. The intermediate representation is converted into binary code by the compiler.
4. The binary code can be executed on the user's computer.

## Examples:

### Real-Life Examples:
- Calculate the discount percentage during a sale.
- Determine the percentage of students who passed an exam.
- Calculate the percentage increase in stock prices.

## Test Cases:

### Test Case 1:
**Input:**
```
Enter number: 25
Enter total number: 100
```
**Output:**
```
Percentage of 25.00 is: 25.00%
```
**Explanation:** 25 is 25% of 100.

### Test Case 2:
**Input:**
```
Enter number: 75
Enter total number: 50
```
**Output:**
```
Percentage of 75.00 is: 150.00%
```
**Explanation:** 75 is 150% of 50.

### Test Case 3:
**Input:**
```
Enter number: 0
Enter total number: 1000
```
**Output:**
```
Percentage of 0.00 is: 0.00%
```
**Explanation:** 0 is 0% of 1000.

## Troubleshooting:

### Common Issues:
- **Input Error:** Ensure that you enter numerical values for 'number' and 'totalNumber.'
- **Division by Zero:** Avoid dividing by zero (totalNumber should not be zero).

### Solutions:
- Double-check your input to ensure it's a valid number.
- If division by zero occurs, handle it gracefully in your code to avoid program crashes.
