# Code Guide - Square Root

## Introduction

This Code Guide explores the implementation of a program to calculate the square root of a given number. It is a fundamental mathematical problem often encountered in various fields, including science, engineering, and computer science. This guide will provide a comprehensive breakdown of the code, step-by-step explanations, complexity analysis, execution details, example use cases, and troubleshooting tips.

## Problem Description

**Problem Statement:** Calculate and display the square root of a given number.

**Input:** A real number (double precision).

**Output:** The square root of the input number, rounded to two decimal places.

## About the Problem

### History

The concept of finding square roots dates back to ancient civilizations, with methods evolving over time. Ancient Egyptians used geometric methods to approximate square roots, while the Babylonians had their own techniques. Today, square root calculations are fundamental in mathematics and have practical applications in various fields, from physics to computer science.

### Information and Trivia

- The square root of a number x is denoted as âˆšx.
- The square root of a negative number is considered a complex number in mathematics.
- Square roots play a crucial role in calculus, geometry, and algebra.

## Approach

### Implementation

The problem is straightforward and can be solved using the built-in `sqrt` function provided by the C++ `<cmath>` library. The approach involves:

1. Accepting user input for the number.
2. Using the `sqrt` function to calculate the square root.
3. Formatting and displaying the result with two decimal places.

### Algorithm & Data Structures

- Algorithm: The algorithm used is simple and relies on the mathematical function `sqrt(x)` to compute the square root.
- Data Structures: No complex data structures are used in this code; it mainly utilizes built-in C++ data types.

## Code Walkthrough

Let's break down the code step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    double number;

    cout << "Enter number: ";
    cin >> number;

    cout << "Square root of " << number << " is: " << fixed << setprecision(2) << sqrt(number) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

1. We include necessary header files (`<iostream>`, `<cmath>`, and `<iomanip>`).
2. We declare a `double` variable `number` to store the user's input.
3. We prompt the user to enter a number and read it using `cin`.
4. We calculate the square root of the entered number using `sqrt(number)`.
5. We format the output to display the result with two decimal places using `fixed` and `setprecision(2)`.
6. Finally, we print the result to the console.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this code is O(1) since the square root calculation and output formatting are constant time operations regardless of the input value.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is also O(1) as it uses a fixed amount of memory to store the `number` variable and other constant space elements.

### Efficiency

This code is highly efficient for calculating square roots of individual numbers. There are no significant areas for optimization.

## Execution

The code is executed by compiling it using a C++ compiler, such as g++, and then running the resulting executable. The program follows these steps:
1. Prompts the user to enter a number.
2. Reads the input.
3. Calculates the square root.
4. Formats and displays the result.

## Examples

This code can be used in various scenarios, including:

1. Engineering: Calculating dimensions or properties of objects, such as the length of a side of a square.
2. Scientific research: Analyzing data that involves square roots, such as in statistical analysis.
3. Computer graphics: Adjusting sizes or distances in graphical applications.

## Test Cases

Here are some test cases to validate the code:

**Input:** 9.0
**Output:** Square root of 9.00 is: 3.00

**Input:** 25.5
**Output:** Square root of 25.50 is: 5.05

**Input:** 0.25
**Output:** Square root of 0.25 is: 0.50

**Input:** -4.0
**Output:** Square root of -4.00 is: nan

**Input:** 144.0
**Output:** Square root of 144.00 is: 12.00

## Troubleshooting

Common issues you may encounter:

1. **Invalid input:** Ensure that the user enters a valid real number. Handling invalid input is not covered in this simple code.

2. **Negative numbers:** The code does not handle complex numbers; thus, the square root of a negative number results in "nan" (not a number). You might want to add error handling for such cases.
