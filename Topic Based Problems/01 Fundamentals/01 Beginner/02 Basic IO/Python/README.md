# Code Guide - The Only Guide You Need!

## Introduction
This Code Guide explains the implementation of a Python script for basic input and output operations. The script collects various types of user input, including strings, integers, floats, complexes, and booleans, and then displays the entered values. It is a fundamental example for beginners to understand basic I/O operations in Python.

## Problem Description
The problem involves collecting user input for different data types and then displaying the entered values. Specifically, it requires taking input for a string, an integer, a float, a complex number, and a boolean value, and then printing these values.

### Input
- The user is prompted to enter values for the five mentioned data types.

### Output
- The script displays the entered values for each data type.

## About the Problem
### History
This problem is a common introductory exercise in programming courses and tutorials. It serves as a foundation for understanding input and output operations in programming.

### Information and Trivias
- This problem showcases the versatility of Python in handling different data types.
- Python's `input()` function is used to collect user input as strings, and then we convert the input to the desired data type.
- Python supports various built-in data types, making it a versatile language for different programming tasks.

## Approach
### Implementation
The script follows a straightforward approach:
1. Prompt the user to enter values for different data types.
2. Use appropriate conversion functions (`int()`, `float()`, `complex()`, and `bool()`) to convert the user input to the desired data types.
3. Print the entered values for each data type.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
No complex algorithms or data structures are required for this problem. It mainly involves user input and data type conversion.

## Code Walkthrough
Let's break down the code step-by-step:

```python
# Prompt the user to enter a string
print("Enter stringValue: ")
stringValue = input()

# Prompt the user to enter an integer and convert it
print("Enter intValue: ")
intValue = int(input())

# Prompt the user to enter a float and convert it
print("Enter floatValue: ")
floatValue = float(input())

# Prompt the user to enter a complex number and convert it
print("Enter complexValue: ")
complexValue = complex(input())

# Prompt the user to enter a boolean and convert it
print("Enter boolValue: ")
boolValue = bool(input())

# Display the entered values
print()
print("stringValue: ", stringValue)
print("intValue: ", intValue)
print("floatValue: ", floatValue)
print("complexValue: ", complexValue)
print("boolValue: ", boolValue)
```

The code sequentially collects input for different data types, converts them, and then displays the entered values.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this code is O(1) because it collects and processes a fixed number of inputs, regardless of their length.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also O(1) since it uses a fixed amount of memory to store the input values and converted variables.

### Efficiency
This code is efficient for its purpose, as it performs the required input and output operations with minimal overhead.

## Execution
The code is executed line by line, following the instructions provided in the script. The `input()` function waits for user input, and the conversion functions transform the input data into the desired data types.

## Examples
This code can be used in various scenarios, such as:
- Creating a basic user input interface for a program.
- Prototyping data entry forms for simple applications.

## Test Cases
Here are some test cases to validate the code:

**Test Case 1:**
- Input:
  - stringValue: "Hello, World!"
  - intValue: 42
  - floatValue: 3.14
  - complexValue: (2+3j)
  - boolValue: True
- Output:
  ```
  stringValue:  Hello, World!
  intValue:  42
  floatValue:  3.14
  complexValue:  (2+3j)
  boolValue:  True
  ```

**Test Case 2:**
- Input:
  - stringValue: "Python"
  - intValue: 100
  - floatValue: 2.71828
  - complexValue: (1-2j)
  - boolValue: False
- Output:
  ```
  stringValue:  Python
  intValue:  100
  floatValue:  2.71828
  complexValue:  (1-2j)
  boolValue:  True
  ```

## Troubleshooting
Common issues that users may encounter:
- Entering incorrect data types (e.g., entering a non-integer for `intValue`) will raise conversion errors.
- Typing errors when entering string values can lead to unexpected results.

To troubleshoot:
- Ensure that the input matches the expected data type.
- Handle exceptions if necessary to prevent program crashes.
