# Code Guide - The Only Guide You Need!

## Introduction

Welcome to the Code Guide for solving the problem "Sum of Two Numbers." In this guide, we will walk you through the process of solving this problem step by step. This problem is a fundamental programming exercise that involves taking two numbers as input and calculating their sum.

## Problem Description

### Problem Statement
Given two integers, your task is to calculate and display their sum.

### Input
- Two integers (firstNumber and secondNumber).

### Output
- The sum of the two integers.

## About the Problem

### History
The concept of adding two numbers is one of the most basic and ancient mathematical operations. It has been used for centuries in various forms of arithmetic and calculation.

### Information and Trivias
- Addition is a fundamental operation in mathematics and is essential in various fields, from everyday calculations to complex scientific research.
- Tables and charts illustrating addition facts and techniques have been used in education for centuries to teach arithmetic.

## Approach

### Implementation
To solve this problem, we'll follow a simple approach:
1. Prompt the user to input two integers: firstNumber and secondNumber.
2. Read and store these integers.
3. Calculate their sum by adding firstNumber and secondNumber.
4. Display the result to the user.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
There's no complex algorithm or data structure required for this problem. It's a straightforward calculation using basic arithmetic operations.

## Code Walkthrough

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int firstNumber, secondNumber;

    // Prompt the user to input the first number
    printf("Enter first number: ");
    scanf("%d", &firstNumber);

    // Prompt the user to input the second number
    printf("Enter second number: ");
    scanf("%d", &secondNumber);

    // Calculate and display the sum
    printf("Sum of %d and %d is: %d\n", firstNumber, secondNumber, firstNumber + secondNumber);

    return 0;
}
```

1. We declare two integer variables `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` to store the input values.
2. We use `printf` and `scanf` to get user input for both numbers.
3. We calculate the sum of `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` and display it using `printf`.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this code is constant, O(1), because it always performs the same number of operations, regardless of the input.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also constant, O(1), as it only uses a fixed amount of memory to store two integers.

### Efficiency
This solution is highly efficient for the given problem, as it directly calculates the sum without unnecessary operations.

## Execution

We execute the code by compiling it using a C compiler (e.g., GCC) and then running the resulting executable. The compiler translates the C code into machine code that can be executed by the computer's CPU.

## Examples

This code can be implemented in various real-life scenarios, such as:
- Accounting software to calculate the total balance.
- Calculators for everyday use.
- Mathematical software for performing arithmetic operations.

## Test Cases

Here are some test cases to validate the code:

1. Input:
   - First Number: 5
   - Second Number: 7
   Output: Sum of 5 and 7 is: 12

2. Input:
   - First Number: -3
   - Second Number: 10
   Output: Sum of -3 and 10 is: 7

3. Input:
   - First Number: 0
   - Second Number: 0
   Output: Sum of 0 and 0 is: 0

### Troubleshooting

Common issues may include:
- Providing non-integer input (e.g., decimals or characters), which will result in incorrect results.
- Compiling errors if the code is not properly formatted or if there are syntax errors.

To handle these issues, ensure that you provide valid integer inputs and double-check the code for any syntax errors.
