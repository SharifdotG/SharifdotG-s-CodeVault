# Code Guide - The Only Guide You Need!

## Introduction
This Code Guide will walk you through the implementation of a simple Java program that calculates the sum of two numbers entered by the user. It is designed to help you understand how the code works and how it solves the problem of adding two numbers together.

## Problem Description
The problem addressed by this code is straightforward: it calculates the sum of two numbers. The user is prompted to input two integers, and the program calculates and displays their sum.

### Problem Statement
Given two integers, the task is to calculate and display their sum.

### Input
- Two integers entered by the user.

### Output
- The sum of the two integers.

## About the Problem
### History
The need to add numbers together is a fundamental mathematical operation that has been essential throughout history. This problem is a basic example of how computers perform arithmetic operations, and it has practical applications in various fields.

### Information and Trivia
- Addition is one of the four basic arithmetic operations.
- The concept of addition is found in nearly every human culture and is among the first mathematical concepts learned by children.

## Approach
### Implementation
The problem is solved using Java programming. The approach is to take user input for two integers, add them together, and then display the result.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
No complex algorithms or data structures are required for this simple problem. The program uses basic input and output operations along with simple arithmetic addition.

## Code Walkthrough
Now, let's break down the code into logical sections and explain each part step-by-step.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SumofTwoNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt the user to enter the first number
        System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
        int firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        // Prompt the user to enter the second number
        System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
        int secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculate the sum and display the result
        System.out.println("Sum of " + firstNumber + " and " + secondNumber + " is: " + (firstNumber + secondNumber));

        // Close the scanner to release resources
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

- We start by importing the `Scanner` class to facilitate user input.
- The program prompts the user to enter the first number and stores it in the `firstNumber` variable.
- Next, it prompts the user to enter the second number and stores it in the `secondNumber` variable.
- The program calculates the sum of the two numbers using `(firstNumber + secondNumber)` and displays the result.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this code is constant (O(1)). Regardless of the input values, the code performs a fixed number of operations.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also constant (O(1)). The code uses a fixed amount of memory to store the input and a few variables.

### Efficiency
The code is highly efficient for this specific task, as it performs the addition operation in constant time.

## Execution
The Java code is executed by first compiling it using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac`) and then running it using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with the `java` command.

## Examples
This code can be used in various real-life scenarios, such as:
- Calculating the total price of items in a shopping cart.
- Determining the sum of scores in a game.
- Calculating the total expenses for a budgeting app.

## Test Cases
Here are some test cases to validate the code:

1. **Input:**  
   ```
   Enter first number: 5
   Enter second number: 3
   ```
   **Output:**  
   ```
   Sum of 5 and 3 is: 8
   ```

2. **Input:**  
   ```
   Enter first number: -2
   Enter second number: 7
   ```
   **Output:**  
   ```
   Sum of -2 and 7 is: 5
   ```

3. **Input:**  
   ```
   Enter first number: 0
   Enter second number: 0
   ```
   **Output:**  
   ```
   Sum of 0 and 0 is: 0
   ```

## Troubleshooting
Common issues or errors users might encounter:
- Input validation is not handled in this code. Users may enter non-integer values, leading to input mismatch errors.
- If the program is not displaying the expected output, ensure that you are entering valid integers.
