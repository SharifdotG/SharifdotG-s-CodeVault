# Code Guide - Kilometers to Miles Conversion

## Introduction
This code guide addresses the problem of converting distances from kilometers to miles. It provides a detailed explanation of the code used to solve this problem, from the problem description to code walkthrough, complexity analysis, and examples.

## Problem Description
The problem is to convert a distance provided in kilometers into miles. The code takes a distance in kilometers as input and calculates and displays the equivalent distance in miles.

### Input:
- A floating-point number representing the distance in kilometers.

### Output:
- The distance converted to miles, displayed with two decimal places.

## About the Problem
### History
The need to convert between different units of measurement, such as kilometers and miles, arises in various real-life situations, particularly in international travel, navigation, and transportation industries.

### Information and Trivias
- 1 kilometer is approximately equal to 0.621371 miles.
- The kilometer is a unit of length in the metric system, while the mile is a unit of length in the imperial system.

## Approach
### Implementation
The code uses a straightforward approach to convert kilometers to miles by multiplying the input distance in kilometers by the conversion factor, which is approximately 0.621371.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
There is no complex algorithm or data structure used in this code. It's a simple mathematical calculation.

## Code Walkthrough
Let's break down the code into logical sections and explain each part step-by-step:

```python
kilometers = float(input("Enter the distance in Kilometers: "))
```
- This line of code takes user input for the distance in kilometers and converts it into a floating-point number for precision.

```python
print(f"Distance in Miles = {kilometers * 0.621371:.2f}")
```
- This line calculates the equivalent distance in miles by multiplying the input in kilometers by the conversion factor (0.621371).
- The result is formatted to display two decimal places using f-strings.
- Finally, it prints the converted distance in miles.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this code is constant (O(1)), as it performs a single arithmetic operation.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also constant (O(1)) since it only uses a fixed amount of memory to store the input and the result.

### Efficiency
The code is efficient for the given task and doesn't require any further optimizations.

## Execution
To execute the code, you can use any Python interpreter. The code will take user input for the distance in kilometers and display the equivalent distance in miles.

## Examples
This code can be implemented in various applications, such as:
- Travel distance calculators
- Fitness apps to convert running distances
- Navigation systems for international travel

## Test Cases
Let's test the code with some example inputs and expected outputs:

**Test Case 1:**
- Input: 10 kilometers
- Output: "Distance in Miles = 6.21"

**Test Case 2:**
- Input: 42.195 kilometers (a marathon distance)
- Output: "Distance in Miles = 26.22"

**Test Case 3:**
- Input: 0.5 kilometers
- Output: "Distance in Miles = 0.31"

## Troubleshooting
Common issues might include:
- Entering non-numeric input: Ensure that the input is a valid floating-point number.
- Incorrect output: Double-check the conversion factor (0.621371) if you encounter unexpected results.
