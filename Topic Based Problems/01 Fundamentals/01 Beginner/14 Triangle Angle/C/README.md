# Code Guide - Triangle Angle

## Introduction
This Code Guide addresses the problem of finding the third angle in a triangle when two angles are given. This is a basic geometry problem that involves simple arithmetic calculations. The code provided in this guide is written in C and demonstrates a straightforward approach to solving the problem.

## Problem Description
### Problem Statement
Given two angles of a triangle, find the measure of the third angle.

### Input
- Two integers representing the measures of two angles of a triangle.

### Output
- An integer representing the measure of the third angle.

## About the Problem
### History
This problem originates from elementary geometry, where the sum of the angles in any triangle is always equal to 180 degrees. Mathematicians and educators have used this problem to teach geometry concepts for centuries.

### Information and Trivia
- The concept of the sum of angles in a triangle adding up to 180 degrees is fundamental in geometry.
- This problem serves as a foundation for more complex geometric calculations.

## Approach
### Implementation
The approach to solving this problem is straightforward:
1. Read two angles as input.
2. Calculate the third angle by subtracting the sum of the two given angles from 180 degrees.
3. Print the result.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
No complex algorithms or data structures are needed for this problem. It relies on basic arithmetic operations.

## Code Walkthrough
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int firstAngle, secondAngle, thirdAngle;

    printf("Enter first angle: ");
    scanf("%d", &firstAngle);

    printf("Enter second angle: ");
    scanf("%d", &secondAngle);

    thirdAngle = 180 - (firstAngle + secondAngle);

    printf("Third angle is: %d\n", thirdAngle);

    return 0;
}
```
- The program takes two angles as input.
- It calculates the third angle by subtracting the sum of the first two angles from 180.
- Finally, it prints the result.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this code is O(1) since it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of memory to store variables.

### Efficiency
This code is highly efficient for solving this particular problem. There are no noticeable areas for optimization.

## Execution
To execute the code:
1. The C code is compiled into machine code by a C compiler.
2. The compiled binary is executed, prompting the user to input the two angles.
3. The program calculates and displays the third angle.

## Examples
This code can be applied in various scenarios where angles of triangles need to be calculated. For instance:
- Architecture: Calculating angles in architectural designs.
- Engineering: Angle calculations in structural engineering.
- Game Development: Calculating angles for character movement in games.

## Test Cases
### Test Case 1:
- Input: 
  - First angle: 60
  - Second angle: 45
- Output:
  - Third angle is: 75

### Test Case 2:
- Input:
  - First angle: 90
  - Second angle: 45
- Output:
  - Third angle is: 45

### Test Case 3:
- Input:
  - First angle: 30
  - Second angle: 90
- Output:
  - Third angle is: 60

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
