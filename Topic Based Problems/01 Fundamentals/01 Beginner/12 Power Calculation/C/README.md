# Code Guide - Power Calculation

## Introduction:
This Code Guide addresses the problem of calculating the power of a given base to a specified exponent. It provides a detailed explanation of the code's implementation, the problem it solves, and how it accomplishes this task.

## Problem Description:
The problem at hand is to calculate the result of raising a given base to a specified exponent. In mathematical terms, it's expressed as: `base^exponent`. The code takes user inputs for the base and exponent, calculates the power, and then displays the result.

### Input:
- The user is prompted to input the base as a double.
- The user is prompted to input the exponent as a double.

### Output:
- The code calculates the result of `base^exponent`.
- It displays the result to the user.

## About the Problem:
### History:
The concept of calculating powers is fundamental in mathematics and has numerous real-life applications, including physics, engineering, and computer science. It's used in fields such as electricity, physics, and computing to model and solve a wide range of problems.

### Information and Trivias:
- Ancient civilizations, like the Greeks and Egyptians, explored exponentiation in various contexts.
- Exponentiation is a key operation in computer programming and scientific computing.
- Tables of powers were historically used for calculations before the advent of computers.

## Approach:
### Implementation:
The code takes a straightforward approach to solving the problem. It uses the `pow` function from the `math.h` library in C to calculate the power of the given base to the specified exponent.

### Algorithm & Data Structures:
No complex algorithms or data structures are used. The `pow` function handles the mathematical calculation internally.

## Code Walkthrough:
1. The code starts by declaring two double variables, `base` and `exponent`, to store user inputs.
2. It prompts the user to input the base and exponent values.
3. The `pow` function from the `math.h` library is used to calculate the power of the base raised to the exponent.
4. The result is displayed to the user.

## Complexity Analysis:
### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the code is primarily determined by the `pow` function, which typically has a time complexity of O(1).

### Space Complexity:
The code has a space complexity of O(1) as it uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of the input values.

### Efficiency:
The solution is highly efficient, as it relies on a well-optimized standard library function for the power calculation.

## Execution:
The code is executed by the C compiler, which translates the source code into binary code that the computer's processor can understand and execute. The binary code is then executed to calculate the power.

## Examples:
The code can be implemented in various scenarios, such as calculating compound interest, physics simulations, and engineering calculations that involve exponentiation.

## Test Cases:
Here are some test cases to validate the code:

1. **Input**: 
   - Base: 2.0
   - Exponent: 3.0
   - **Expected Output**: Power of 2.00 to the 3.00 is: 8.00

2. **Input**: 
   - Base: 5.0
   - Exponent: 0.5
   - **Expected Output**: Power of 5.00 to the 0.50 is: 2.24

3. **Input**: 
   - Base: 10.0
   - Exponent: -2.0
   - **Expected Output**: Power of 10.00 to the -2.00 is: 0.01

## Troubleshooting:
- Ensure that the user inputs are valid numbers.
- Make sure to include the math library by using `#include <math.h>`.
