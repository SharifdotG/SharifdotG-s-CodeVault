# Code Guide - Power Calculation

## Introduction
This Code Guide provides a comprehensive overview of the "Power Calculation" problem and the corresponding Java code that solves it. The problem involves calculating the result of raising a given base to a specified exponent.

## Problem Description
### Problem Statement
The problem is to calculate the power of a given base to a specified exponent.

### Input
- Two floating-point numbers: `base` and `exponent`, where `base` represents the base number, and `exponent` represents the exponent to which the base should be raised.

### Output
- A single floating-point number representing the result of raising `base` to the power of `exponent`.

## About the Problem
### History
The concept of calculating powers is fundamental in mathematics and has applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, and computer science. It is widely used in scientific calculations and computer programming.

### Information and Trivia
- The power operation is often denoted as `base^exponent` in mathematical notation.
- The `Math.pow` function in Java's `Math` library is a commonly used utility to calculate powers.

## Approach
### Implementation
The problem is solved using Java programming. We use the `Scanner` class to take user input for the base and exponent. Then, we apply the `Math.pow` function to calculate the result of raising the base to the exponent.

### Algorithm & Data Structures
No complex algorithms or data structures are required for this problem. It involves basic arithmetic operations using the `Math.pow` function.

## Code Walkthrough
### Code Structure
1. Initialize two double variables, `base` and `exponent`.
2. Use the `Scanner` class to take user input for `base` and `exponent`.
3. Apply the `Math.pow` function to calculate the result and print it.

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.print("Enter base: ");
base = scanner.nextDouble();

System.out.print("Enter exponent: ");
exponent = scanner.nextDouble();

System.out.printf("Power of %.2f to the %.2f is: %.2f\n", base, exponent, Math.pow(base, exponent));
```

### Key Insights
- The use of `Math.pow` makes it easy to calculate powers in Java without writing custom power calculation logic.
- The use of `printf` allows for formatting the output to display the result with a specific number of decimal places.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this code is O(1) since the `Math.pow` function performs the power calculation in constant time.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also O(1) because only a few double variables (`base`, `exponent`) and the `Scanner` object are used, and their memory usage does not depend on the input size.

### Efficiency
The solution is efficient as it leverages the built-in `Math.pow` function, which is optimized for power calculations. There are no apparent areas for further optimization.

## Execution
The code is executed by taking user input for the base and exponent values, performing the power calculation using `Math.pow`, and then displaying the result. The `Scanner` class facilitates user input, and the `System.out.printf` statement is used to display the result.

## Examples
### Real-life Examples
- Calculating compound interest, where the exponent represents the number of compounding periods.
- Physics calculations, such as calculating the force of gravity or electrical resistance.

## Test Cases
### Test Case 1
**Input:**
```
Enter base: 2.5
Enter exponent: 3.0
```
**Output:**
```
Power of 2.50 to the 3.00 is: 15.63
```
**Rationale:** 2.5^3.0 = 15.625

### Test Case 2
**Input:**
```
Enter base: 0.0
Enter exponent: 5.0
```
**Output:**
```
Power of 0.00 to the 5.00 is: 0.00
```
**Rationale:** 0.0^5.0 = 0.0

### Test Case 3
**Input:**
```
Enter base: -2.0
Enter exponent: 4.0
```
**Output:**
```
Power of -2.00 to the 4.00 is: 16.00
```
**Rationale:** (-2.0)^4.0 = 16.0

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
- Incorrect input format: Ensure that the user enters valid floating-point numbers for the base and exponent.
- Incorrect result: Double-check that the `Math.pow` function is used correctly and that the output is formatted as expected.

### Solutions
- Add input validation to handle incorrect input formats.
- Verify that the `Math.pow` function is applied correctly and that the format string in `printf` is accurate.
