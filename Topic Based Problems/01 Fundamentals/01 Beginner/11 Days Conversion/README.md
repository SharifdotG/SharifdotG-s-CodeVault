# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description

You are given a certain number of days, and your task is to convert these days into a specific time format. The problem involves converting a given number of days into years, months, and remaining days. This requires understanding how many days are in a year and how many days are in each month.

### Example Input and Output

**Input:**
- 365

**Output:**
- 1 year(s), 0 month(s), 0 day(s)

**Input:**
- 450

**Output:**
- 1 year(s), 2 month(s), 15 day(s)

**Input:**
- 30

**Output:**
- 0 year(s), 1 month(s), 0 day(s)

### Constraints

- The input is a non-negative integer representing the number of days (0 ≤ days ≤ 10^6).

## Understand the Problem

Before diving into coding, let's break down the problem into smaller components:

1. We need to determine how many years are in the given number of days.
2. Then, we should find out how many months are left after accounting for the years.
3. Finally, we need to calculate the remaining days.

## Possible Approaches

There are multiple ways to solve this problem. Here are a couple of possible approaches:

1. **Mathematical Approach**: You can calculate the years, months, and days by using integer division and modulus operations. This approach involves understanding how many days are in a year and in each month, then performing the calculations accordingly.

2. **Loop Approach**: You can use loops to subtract years and months from the given number of days iteratively until you have the remaining days.

## Plan the Approach

Let's go with the mathematical approach as it's more straightforward and efficient:

1. Calculate the number of years by dividing the given days by 365. Store this value.
2. Calculate the remaining days after accounting for the years by taking the modulus of the given days with 365.
3. Calculate the number of months from the remaining days by dividing it by the average number of days in a month (30.44). Store this value.
4. Calculate the remaining days again by taking the modulus of the remaining days with the average number of days in a month.
5. The number of years, months, and remaining days will be our answer.

Now, let's formalize this approach into an algorithm.

## Algorithm

1. Read the number of days as input and store it in a variable `totalDays`.
2. Calculate the number of years as `years = totalDays / 365`.
3. Calculate the remaining days after accounting for years as `remainingDays = totalDays % 365`.
4. Calculate the number of months as `months = remainingDays / 30.44` (average days in a month).
5. Calculate the remaining days again as `remainingDays = remainingDays % 30.44`.
6. The values of `years`, `months`, and `remainingDays` are our answer.

## Pseudocode

Here's the pseudocode representation of the solution:

```
1. Read totalDays
2. years = totalDays / 365
3. remainingDays = totalDays % 365
4. months = remainingDays / 30.44
5. remainingDays = remainingDays % 30.44
6. Print "Years: ", years
7. Print "Months: ", months
8. Print "Days: ", remainingDays
```

## Test Cases

Test the solution with these additional cases:

**Input:**
- 0
**Output:**
- 0 year(s), 0 month(s), 0 day(s)

**Input:**
- 730
**Output:**
- 2 year(s), 0 month(s), 0 day(s)

**Input:**
- 367
**Output:**
- 1 year(s), 0 month(s), 2 day(s)

**Input:**
- 500
**Output:**
- 1 year(s), 4 month(s), 10 day(s)

## Final Remarks

Before checking the code, try to implement this solution on your own. Understanding the logic behind it is crucial. If you encounter any issues, feel free to refer to the provided pseudocode. Also, don't forget to handle edge cases like leap years, and ensure that the division and modulus operations are done with floating-point numbers for precise results. Happy coding!
