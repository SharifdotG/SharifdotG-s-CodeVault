# Code Guide - The Only Guide You Need!

## Introduction:
This Code Guide will walk you through a C++ program that performs basic arithmetic operations. The program takes two user-input numbers and calculates their sum, difference, product, and quotient. It serves as a fundamental example of how to perform simple calculations in C++.

## Problem Description:
The problem addressed by this code is to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers entered by the user. The operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program will output the results of these operations.

**Input:**
- Two integer numbers entered by the user.

**Output:**
- The sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two input numbers.

## About the Problem:

### History:
Basic arithmetic operations have been a fundamental part of mathematics and computer science for centuries. They are used in countless real-world applications, from finance to physics, to solve various problems.

### Information and Trivias:
- Arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- These operations are foundational in mathematics and computer programming.
- Arithmetic operations are used extensively in scientific and engineering calculations.

## Approach:

### Implementation:
To solve the problem, we implement a C++ program that follows these steps:
1. Prompt the user to enter two integer numbers.
2. Read the input numbers.
3. Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers.
4. Display the results to the user.

### Algorithm & Data Structures:
There is no complex algorithm involved in this code. It simply uses basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to calculate the desired results. The data structure used is variables to store user input and intermediate results.

## Code Walkthrough:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int firstNumber, secondNumber;

    // Prompt the user for input
    cout << "Enter first number: ";
    cin >> firstNumber;

    cout << "Enter second number: ";
    cin >> secondNumber;

    // Perform arithmetic operations and display results
    cout << "Sum of " << firstNumber << " and " << secondNumber << " is: " << firstNumber + secondNumber << endl;
    cout << "Difference of " << firstNumber << " and " << secondNumber << " is: " << firstNumber - secondNumber << endl;
    cout << "Product of " << firstNumber << " and " << secondNumber << " is: " << firstNumber * secondNumber << endl;
    cout << "Quotient of " << firstNumber << " and " << secondNumber << " is: " << firstNumber / secondNumber << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Complexity Analysis:

#### Time Complexity:
- Reading input and performing arithmetic operations takes constant time, O(1).
- Therefore, the time complexity of this program is O(1).

#### Space Complexity:
- The program uses a constant amount of memory to store input variables and display results.
- Thus, the space complexity is also O(1).

#### Efficiency:
- The program is highly efficient as it performs simple arithmetic operations.

## Execution:

The code is executed as follows:
1. Compilation: The source code is compiled using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to generate machine code.
2. Linking: The machine code is linked with necessary libraries.
3. Execution: The compiled code is executed, prompting the user for input and displaying results.

## Examples:

This code can be used in various real-life scenarios, such as:
- Building a simple calculator application.
- Performing financial calculations, such as interest rate calculations.
- Writing code for scientific simulations that involve mathematical computations.

## Test Cases:

### Test Case 1:
**Input:**
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
```
**Output:**
```
Sum of 10 and 5 is: 15
Difference of 10 and 5 is: 5
Product of 10 and 5 is: 50
Quotient of 10 and 5 is: 2
```

### Test Case 2:
**Input:**
```
Enter first number: -7
Enter second number: 3
```
**Output:**
```
Sum of -7 and 3 is: -4
Difference of -7 and 3 is: -10
Product of -7 and 3 is: -21
Quotient of -7 and 3 is: -2
```

## Troubleshooting:

**Common Issues:**
- Division by zero: If the second number is zero, division by zero will occur, leading to an error. Ensure that the second number is not zero.

**Solutions:**
- Implement error handling to check for division by zero and inform the user.
