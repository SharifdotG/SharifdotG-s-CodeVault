## Hello World

### Introduction
Welcome to SharifdotG's CodeVault! This repository is dedicated to providing clear and detailed solutions to various coding problems, aimed at helping fellow learners understand coding concepts more effectively. In this guide, we'll dive into the problem "Hello World" and provide a comprehensive walkthrough of the solution.

### Problem Description
The "Hello World" problem is a fundamental starting point in programming. It involves printing the famous phrase "Hello World!" to the console. The objective is to introduce beginners to the basic syntax of a programming language and the process of producing output.

**Problem Statement:** Print the phrase "Hello World!"

**Input:** None
**Output:** "Hello World!"

### About the Problem
The "Hello World" problem holds historical significance in the world of programming. It originated as a simple test to verify the functionality of a programming language, making sure that the compiler or interpreter was working correctly. While the problem itself doesn't have complex real-world applications, it serves as an essential foundation for understanding how to interact with the programming environment.

### Approach
The approach to solving the "Hello World" problem is incredibly straightforward. Since the goal is to print a specific string, there's no need for complex algorithms or data structures. The primary focus is on understanding the basic syntax of the programming language.

### Code Walkthrough
Let's dive into the code step by step:

```python
# Print the "Hello World!" phrase to the console
print("Hello World!")
```

1. The `print` function is a built-in function in many programming languages that outputs a specified message to the console.
2. The message to be printed is enclosed in double quotation marks: `"Hello World!"`.

### Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this code is constant (O(1)), as it involves a single `print` statement that executes once. The space complexity is also constant, as it doesn't require any additional memory that scales with the input size.

### Examples
Let's walk through a couple of examples:

**Example 1:**
Input: None
Output: "Hello World!"

### Test Cases
| Input | Expected Output |
|-------|-----------------|
| None  | "Hello World!" |

### Troubleshooting
Common issues users might encounter:
- **Syntax Errors:** Make sure there are no typos or missing characters in the code.
- **Output Not Visible:** Ensure that the console or terminal is open to view the output.
