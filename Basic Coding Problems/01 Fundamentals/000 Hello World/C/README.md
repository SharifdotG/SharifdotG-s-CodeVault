## Hello World

### Introduction
Welcome to SharifdotG's CodeVault! This repository is dedicated to helping fellow learners understand and master various programming concepts through a collection of carefully categorized code snippets. In this Code Guide, we will explore the classic "Hello World" problem, which serves as a fundamental introduction to programming. By following this guide, you'll gain insights into the problem-solving process, code structure, and essential programming concepts.

### Problem Description
The "Hello World" problem is a simple yet essential task in programming. The goal is to create a program that prints the message "Hello World!" to the standard output. This problem serves as a starting point for beginners to become familiar with basic syntax and program execution.

#### Problem Statement
Write a program that prints the message "Hello World!" to the standard output.

#### Input
This problem does not require any input.

#### Output
Print the following message to the standard output:
```
Hello World!
```

### About the Problem
The "Hello World" problem has historical significance in the field of computer programming. It is often the first program written by individuals when learning a new programming language. The program's simplicity allows beginners to focus on understanding the fundamental structure of a program, including headers, main functions, and print statements.

### Approach
To solve the "Hello World" problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary header file.
2. Define the `main` function.
3. Use the `printf` function to print the desired message.

### Code Walkthrough
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Print the message "Hello World!" to the standard output
    printf("Hello World!\n");

    // Return 0 to indicate successful program execution
    return 0;
}
```

In this code snippet, we start by including the `<stdio.h>` header, which contains the necessary declarations for input and output functions. The `main` function is the entry point of our program. Inside the `main` function, we use the `printf` function to print the message "Hello World!" to the standard output. The `\n` sequence represents a newline character, which moves the cursor to the next line after printing.

### Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this solution is constant, O(1), as it involves a single print operation. The space complexity is also constant, as it doesn't depend on the input size.

### Examples
Let's examine the program execution for two examples:

Example 1:
Input: N/A
Output:
```
Hello World!
```

### Test Cases
Here are some test cases to validate the code:

| Input | Output         |
|-------|----------------|
| N/A   | Hello World!  |

### Troubleshooting
Common issues that may arise include:
- Forgetting to include the `<stdio.h>` header.
- Misspelling the `printf` function or the message itself.
- Omitting the newline character `\n`.
