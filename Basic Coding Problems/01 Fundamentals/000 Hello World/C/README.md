## Hello World

### Introduction
Welcome to SharifdotG's CodeVault! This repository is dedicated to helping fellow learners understand and master various programming problems. In this guide, we'll walk you through the problem "Hello World" and provide a detailed explanation of the code implementation. Our goal is to make learning coding concepts easier and more accessible.

### Problem Description
The "Hello World" problem is a classic introductory exercise in programming. The task is simple: write a program that outputs the phrase "Hello World!" to the console. This exercise helps beginners get familiar with basic syntax and the process of running a program.

**Input:** None
**Output:** The string "Hello World!" followed by a newline character.

### About the Problem
The "Hello World" problem has historical significance in the world of computer programming. It serves as a starting point for learning new programming languages and testing compiler or interpreter setups. Although seemingly trivial, this exercise plays a crucial role in introducing developers to the fundamentals of coding.

### Approach
Our approach to solving the "Hello World" problem is straightforward. We will use the C programming language to print the desired string to the console. No complex algorithms or data structures are needed for this task.

### Code Walkthrough
Let's break down the code step by step:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello World!\n");

    return 0;
}
```

1. We begin by including the `stdio.h` header, which provides functions for input and output operations.
2. The `main` function serves as the entry point of our program.
3. Inside the `main` function, we use the `printf` function to print the string "Hello World!" to the console.
4. The `\n` at the end of the string represents a newline character, which moves the cursor to the next line after printing.
5. Finally, we use `return 0;` to indicate that our program has executed successfully.

### Complexity Analysis
The "Hello World" program is extremely simple and has a time complexity of O(1), meaning it executes in constant time. It also has a space complexity of O(1) since it uses a fixed amount of memory to print the output.

### Examples
Let's consider an example to demonstrate the code execution:

**Input:** None
**Output:**
```
Hello World!
```

### Test Cases
Here are a few test cases to validate the code:

| Input | Expected Output |
|-------|-----------------|
| None  | Hello World!   |

### Troubleshooting
In case you encounter any issues while running the code, ensure that you have a valid C compiler installed. Make sure the code is free from typos or syntax errors. If you face difficulties, feel free to reach out for assistance.
