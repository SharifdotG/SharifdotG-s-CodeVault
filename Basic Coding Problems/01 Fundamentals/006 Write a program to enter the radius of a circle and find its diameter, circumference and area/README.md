# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that will calculate the diameter, circumference and area of a circle given the radius. The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. The diameter is twice the radius, and the circumference is the distance around the circle. The area is the amount of space enclosed by the circle.

To solve this problem, you will need to use the following formulas:

* `Diameter: D = 2r`
* `Circumference: C = 2πr`
* `Area: A = πr²`

Where:

* r is the radius of the circle
* π is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14

Here is an algorithm for solving this problem:

1. Get the radius of the circle from the user.
2. Calculate the diameter of the circle.
3. Calculate the circumference of the circle.
4. Calculate the area of the circle.
5. Print the results.

Here is a pseudocode for solving this problem:

```
procedure calculate_circle_properties(radius)
  diameter = 2 * radius
  circumference = 2 * π * radius
  area = π * radius ^ 2
  print(diameter, circumference, area)
end procedure
```

I hope this Code Hint helps you solve the problem!
