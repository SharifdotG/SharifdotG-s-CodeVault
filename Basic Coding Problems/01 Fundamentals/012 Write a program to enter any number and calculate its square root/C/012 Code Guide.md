# Here is the Code Guide for the square root program:

## The Problem

The problem is to write a program that enters any number and calculates its square root. The square root of a number is a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the original number. For example, the square root of 9 is 3 because 3 * 3 = 9.

## Code Explanation

The code for the square root program is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    int number;
    float square_root;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    square_root = sqrt(number);

    printf("The square root of %d is %f\n", number, square_root);

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code includes the `stdio.h` header file, which contains the `printf()` and `scanf()` functions. The second line of code includes the `math.h` header file, which contains the `sqrt()` function.

The `main()` function is the starting point of the program. It first declares three variables: `number`, `square_root`, and `float`. The `number` variable is used to store the user-entered number. The `square_root` variable is used to store the square root of the user-entered number. The `float` variable is used to specify that the `square_root` variable is a floating-point number.

The next line of code uses the `printf()` function to prompt the user to enter a number. The `scanf()` function is then used to read the user's input and store it in the `number` variable.

The next line of code uses the `sqrt()` function to calculate the square root of the `number` variable. The `sqrt()` function returns a floating-point number, so the `square_root` variable is declared as a floating-point number.

The next line of code uses the `printf()` function to print the square root of the `number` variable. The `%f` format specifier is used to specify that the square root is a floating-point number.

The last line of code returns 0, which indicates that the program has terminated successfully.
