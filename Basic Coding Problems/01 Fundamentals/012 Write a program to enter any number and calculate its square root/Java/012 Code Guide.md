# Here is the Code Guide for the Java program to calculate the square root of a number:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that allows the user to enter any number and then calculates its square root. The square root of a number is a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the original number. For example, the square root of 9 is 3 because 3 x 3 = 9.

**Code Explanation**

The code to solve this problem is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class square_root {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();

        float squareRoot = (float) Math.sqrt(number);

        System.out.println("The square root of " + number + " is " + squareRoot);
    }
}
```

The first line of code imports the `java.util.Scanner` class, which allows the program to read input from the user. The next line creates a new `Scanner` object and assigns it to the variable `scanner`.

The next line of code prints a message to the user asking them to enter a number. The user's input is then stored in the variable `number`.

The next line of code calls the `Math.sqrt()` method to calculate the square root of `number`. The `Math.sqrt()` method returns a `double` value, so the result is cast to a `float` value before it is stored in the variable `squareRoot`.

The final line of code prints the square root of `number` to the console.

**Conclusion**

This code can be used to calculate the square root of any number. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment on the repository.
