# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that takes a number as input and calculates its square root. The square root of a number is a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the original number. For example, the square root of 9 is 3, because 3 * 3 = 9.

There are two main approaches to solving this problem:

* **Using the built-in square root function.** Many programming languages have a built-in function for calculating the square root of a number. For example, in Python, you can use the `math.sqrt()` function to calculate the square root of a number.
* **Using a recursive algorithm.** A recursive algorithm is a function that calls itself to solve a problem. One way to calculate the square root of a number using a recursive algorithm is to start with a guess for the square root and then keep guessing higher or lower until you find a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the original number.

Here is an algorithm for calculating the square root of a number using a recursive algorithm:

```
def square_root(number):
    if number == 0 or number == 1:
        return number

    guess = number / 2
    while guess * guess != number:
        if guess * guess < number:
            guess += 1
        else:
            guess -= 1

    return guess
```

Here is a pseudocode for calculating the square root of a number using a recursive algorithm:

```
SQUARE_ROOT(number)
    if number == 0 or number == 1:
        return number

    guess := number / 2
    while guess * guess != number:
        if guess * guess < number:
            guess := guess + 1
        else:
            guess := guess - 1

    return guess
```

I hope this code hint helps you solve the problem!
