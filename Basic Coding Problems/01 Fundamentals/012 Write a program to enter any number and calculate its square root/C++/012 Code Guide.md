# Here is the Code Guide for the problem of calculating the square root of a number:

**Problem:**

The problem is to write a program that enters any number and calculates its square root.

**Code Explanation:**

The code is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int number;
    float square_root;

    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> number;

    square_root = sqrt(number);

    cout << "The square root of " << number << " is " << square_root << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code includes the `iostream` header file, which contains the `cout` and `cin` objects that are used to print and read data from the console. The second line includes the `cmath` header file, which contains the `sqrt()` function that is used to calculate the square root of a number.

The next few lines of code declare the variables `number` and `square_root`. The `number` variable will store the number that is entered by the user, and the `square_root` variable will store the square root of the number.

The next line of code uses the `cout` object to print a message to the console asking the user to enter a number. The next line of code uses the `cin` object to read the number that the user enters.

The next line of code uses the `sqrt()` function to calculate the square root of the number that the user entered. The `sqrt()` function takes a number as an argument and returns the square root of that number.

The next line of code uses the `cout` object to print the square root of the number that the user entered.

The last line of code returns the value 0, which indicates that the program terminated successfully.

**Conclusion:**

This code guide provides a detailed explanation of the code that was used to calculate the square root of a number. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment in the repository.
