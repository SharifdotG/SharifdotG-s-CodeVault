# Here is the Code Guide for the program to convert days into years, weeks and days:

## The Problem

The problem is to write a program that takes an input of the number of days and outputs the number of years, weeks, and days.

## Code Explanation

The code is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int number_of_days;
    int years;
    int weeks;
    int remaining_days;

    cout << "Enter the number of days: ";
    cin >> number_of_days;

    years = number_of_days / 365;
    remaining_days = number_of_days % 365;
    weeks = remaining_days / 7;
    remaining_days = remaining_days % 7;

    cout << "Years: " << years << endl;
    cout << "Weeks: " << weeks << endl;
    cout << "Days: " << remaining_days << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The first step is to declare the variables that will be used in the program. These variables are:

* `number_of_days`: The number of days that will be entered by the user.
* `years`: The number of years that is equivalent to the number of days.
* `weeks`: The number of weeks that is equivalent to the number of days.
* `remaining_days`: The number of days that is left after the number of years and weeks have been calculated.

The next step is to get the number of days from the user. This is done by using the `cin` object to read the input from the user.

```c++
cout << "Enter the number of days: ";
cin >> number_of_days;
```

The next step is to calculate the number of years, weeks, and remaining days. This is done by using the following code:

```c++
years = number_of_days / 365;
remaining_days = number_of_days % 365;
weeks = remaining_days / 7;
remaining_days = remaining_days % 7;
```

The `/` operator is used to divide the number of days by 365. The `%` operator is used to get the remainder after the division.

The final step is to print the number of years, weeks, and remaining days. This is done by using the `cout` object to print the output to the console.

```c++
cout << "Years: " << years << endl;
cout << "Weeks: " << weeks << endl;
cout << "Days: " << remaining_days << endl;
```

## Conclusion

This is the code guide for the program to convert days into years, weeks and days. I hope this explanation is clear and concise. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment in the repository.
