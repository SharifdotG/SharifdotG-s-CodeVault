# Here is the Code Guide for the C program to convert days into years, weeks and days:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that takes a number of days as input and outputs the number of years, weeks, and days that correspond to that number of days.

**Code Explanation**

The code for this problem is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number_of_days;
    int years;
    int weeks;
    int remaining_days;

    printf("Enter the number of days: ");
    scanf("%d", &number_of_days);

    years = number_of_days / 365;
    remaining_days = number_of_days % 365;
    weeks = remaining_days / 7;
    remaining_days = remaining_days % 7;

    printf("Years: %d\n", years);
    printf("Weeks: %d\n", weeks);
    printf("Days: %d\n", remaining_days);

    return 0;
}
```

The first step in the code is to declare the variables that will be used. These variables are:

* `number_of_days`: This variable will store the number of days that is entered by the user.
* `years`: This variable will store the number of years that correspond to the number of days entered by the user.
* `weeks`: This variable will store the number of weeks that correspond to the number of days entered by the user.
* `remaining_days`: This variable will store the number of days that are left over after the number of years and weeks have been calculated.

The next step in the code is to get the number of days from the user. This is done using the `scanf()` function.

```c
printf("Enter the number of days: ");
scanf("%d", &number_of_days);
```

The next step in the code is to calculate the number of years, weeks, and remaining days. This is done using the following code:

```c
years = number_of_days / 365;
remaining_days = number_of_days % 365;
weeks = remaining_days / 7;
remaining_days = remaining_days % 7;
```

The `/` operator is used to divide the number of days by 365, which gives the number of years. The `%` operator is used to find the remainder after the number of days is divided by 365, which gives the number of days that are left over. The `/` operator is then used to divide the number of days that are left over by 7, which gives the number of weeks. The `%` operator is then used to find the remainder after the number of days that are left over are divided by 7, which gives the number of days that are left over.

The final step in the code is to print the number of years, weeks, and remaining days. This is done using the following code:

```c
printf("Years: %d\n", years);
printf("Weeks: %d\n", weeks);
printf("Days: %d\n", remaining_days);
```
