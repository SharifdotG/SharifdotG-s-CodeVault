# Here is the Code Guide for the program to convert days into years, weeks, and days:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that takes in a number of days as input and outputs the number of years, weeks, and days that make up that number of days.

**Code Explanation**

The code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class days_to_years_weeks_days {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the number of days: ");
        int number_of_days = scanner.nextInt();

        int years = number_of_days / 365;
        int remaining_days = number_of_days % 365;
        int weeks = remaining_days / 7;
        int remaining_days_2 = remaining_days % 7;

        System.out.println("Years: " + years);
        System.out.println("Weeks: " + weeks);
        System.out.println("Days: " + remaining_days_2);
    }
}
```

The first line imports the `Scanner` class, which is used to read input from the user. The next line creates a new `Scanner` object and assigns it to the variable `scanner`.

The next line prints a message to the user asking them to enter the number of days. The user's input is then stored in the variable `number_of_days`.

The next few lines calculate the number of years, weeks, and days that make up the number of days entered by the user. The number of years is calculated by dividing the number of days by 365. The remaining days are then divided by 7 to get the number of weeks. The remaining days after that are the number of days.

The final few lines print out the number of years, weeks, and days to the console.

**Conclusion**

This code is a simple and straightforward way to convert days into years, weeks, and days. The code is well-commented, so it should be easy to understand for anyone who is familiar with Java. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment on the repository.

I hope this Code Guide is helpful!
