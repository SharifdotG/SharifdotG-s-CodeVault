# Here is the code guide for the Java program to enter two angles of a triangle and find the third angle:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that takes two angles of a triangle as input and outputs the third angle. The sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees, so the third angle can be found by subtracting the two given angles from 180 degrees.

**Code Explanation**

The code for this problem is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class triangle_angles {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first angle: ");
        int firstAngle = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter the second angle: ");
        int secondAngle = scanner.nextInt();

        int thirdAngle = 180 - (firstAngle + secondAngle);

        System.out.println("The third angle of the triangle is: " + thirdAngle);
    }
}
```

The first line imports the `java.util.Scanner` class, which is used to read input from the user. The next two lines declare two variables, `firstAngle` and `secondAngle`, to store the two angles of the triangle. The `main()` method then prompts the user to enter the two angles and stores their values in the `firstAngle` and `secondAngle` variables.

The next line calculates the third angle of the triangle by subtracting the two given angles from 180 degrees. The `thirdAngle` variable is then printed to the console.

**Conclusion**

This code guide has explained the problem and the code for a Java program to enter two angles of a triangle and find the third angle. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment on the repository.

Here are some additional notes about the code:

* The `Scanner` class is a built-in class in Java that can be used to read input from the user.
* The `System.out.println()` method is used to print text to the console.
* The `-` operator is used to subtract two numbers.
* The `180` constant represents the number of degrees in a full circle.

I hope this code guide is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
