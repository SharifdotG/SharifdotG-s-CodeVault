# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that enters two angles of a triangle and finds the third angle. The sum of the three angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, so you can use this fact to find the third angle.

Here are some tips and tricks for solving this problem:

* Start by defining three variables to store the two angles that you will be entering and the third angle that you will be calculating.
* Prompt the user to enter the two angles of the triangle.
* Calculate the third angle using the following formula:

```
third_angle = 180 - (angle_1 + angle_2)
```

* Print the value of the third angle.

Here is an algorithm for solving this problem:


1. Define three variables to store the two angles that you will be entering and the third angle that you will be calculating.
2. Prompt the user to enter the two angles of the triangle.
3. Calculate the third angle using the following formula:

```
third_angle = 180 - (angle_1 + angle_2)
```

4. Print the value of the third angle.

Here is a pseudocode for solving this problem:

```
ALGORITHM FindThirdAngle

INPUT: two angles of a triangle
OUTPUT: third angle of the triangle

BEGIN

  DEFINE angle_1, angle_2, third_angle AS INTEGER

  READ angle_1, angle_2

  third_angle = 180 - (angle_1 + angle_2)

  PRINT third_angle

END
```

I hope this helps!
