# Here is the guideline for the coding problem:

**How to understand the problem**

The first step to solving any coding problem is to understand the problem. In this case, the problem is to write a C program to enter two angles of a triangle and find the third angle.

To understand the problem, we need to know the following:

* What is a triangle?
* What are the three angles of a triangle?
* How do we calculate the third angle of a triangle?

**How to approach the problem**

Once we understand the problem, we need to approach it in a systematic way. The following steps can be used to approach this problem:

1. Define the variables that will be used in the program.
2. Write the code to prompt the user to enter the two angles of the triangle.
3. Write the code to read the two angles from the user.
4. Write the code to calculate the third angle of the triangle.
5. Write the code to print the third angle of the triangle.

**How to solve the problem**

The code below solves the problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int first_angle;
  int second_angle;
  int third_angle;

  printf("Enter the first angle: ");
  scanf("%d", &first_angle);

  printf("Enter the second angle: ");
  scanf("%d", &second_angle);

  third_angle = 180 - (first_angle + second_angle);

  printf("The third angle of the triangle is: %d\n", third_angle);

  return 0;
}
```

This code first defines three variables: `first_angle`, `second_angle`, and `third_angle`. These variables will be used to store the three angles of the triangle.

The code then prompts the user to enter the two angles of the triangle. The user's input is read into the `first_angle` and `second_angle` variables.

The code then calculates the third angle of the triangle. The third angle is calculated by subtracting the sum of the first two angles from 180 degrees.

Finally, the code prints the third angle of the triangle to the console.
