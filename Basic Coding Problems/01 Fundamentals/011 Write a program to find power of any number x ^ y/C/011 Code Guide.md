# Here is the Code Guide for the C program to find power of any number x^y:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a C program to find the power of any number x^y. This can be solved using the pow() function, which is present in the math.h header file. The pow() function takes two arguments: the base and the exponent. The result of the pow() function is the base raised to the power of the exponent.

**Code Explanation**

The code for the problem is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    int base, power, result;

    printf("Enter the base: ");
    scanf("%d", &base);

    printf("Enter the power: ");
    scanf("%d", &power);

    result = pow(base, power);

    printf("The value of %d ^ %d is %d\n", base, power, result);

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of the code includes the `stdio.h` header file, which contains the `printf()` and `scanf()` functions. The second line of the code includes the `math.h` header file, which contains the `pow()` function.

The next three lines of the code declare the variables `base`, `power`, and `result`. The `base` variable stores the base of the power, the `power` variable stores the exponent, and the `result` variable stores the result of the power calculation.

The next four lines of the code prompt the user to enter the base and the exponent, and then read the values entered by the user into the `base` and `power` variables.

The next line of the code calls the `pow()` function to calculate the power of the base raised to the power of the exponent. The `pow()` function returns the result of the calculation, which is stored in the `result` variable.

The next line of the code prints the value of the power calculation.

The last line of the code returns 0, which indicates that the program terminated successfully.

**Conclusion**

This code guide has explained how to write a C program to find the power of any number x^y. The code is highly detailed and concise, so that everyone can understand it without any issues. If you have any queries about the code, you can comment in the repository anytime.
