# Here is the Code Guide for the problem of finding the power of a number x^y in Java:

**Problem:**

The problem is to write a program that takes two integers as input, the base and the exponent, and calculates the value of the base raised to the power of the exponent.

**Code Explanation:**

The code for this problem is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class power {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the base: ");
        int base = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter the power: ");
        int power = scanner.nextInt();

        int result = (int) Math.pow(base, power);

        System.out.println("The value of " + base + "^" + power + " is " + result);
    }
}
```

The code first imports the `java.util.Scanner` class, which is used to read input from the user. Then, it creates a `Scanner` object and uses it to read the base and the exponent from the user.

Next, the code uses the `Math.pow()` method to calculate the value of the base raised to the power of the exponent. The `Math.pow()` method takes two arguments, the base and the exponent, and returns the value of the base raised to the power of the exponent.

Finally, the code prints the value of the base raised to the power of the exponent.

**Conclusion:**

This code can be used to find the power of any number x^y. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment in the repository.

Here are some additional points to note about the code:

* The `Scanner` class is a standard Java class that is used to read input from the user.
* The `Math.pow()` method is a static method in the `Math` class. Static methods can be called without creating an object of the class.
* The `System.out.println()` method is used to print output to the console.

I hope this Code Guide is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
