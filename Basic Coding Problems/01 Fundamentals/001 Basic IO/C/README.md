# Code Guide: Basic I/O

## Introduction
Welcome to SharifdotG's CodeVault, a repository dedicated to helping fellow learners understand and master various programming concepts. In this guide, we will delve into the fundamental topic of Basic Input/Output (I/O) in programming. Through a detailed code walkthrough, we will explore how to efficiently read and write different types of data using C programming language.

## Problem Description
The "Basic I/O" problem revolves around the concept of input and output operations in programming. It requires you to read various data types from the user and display them on the screen. This problem is essential as it forms the foundation for building interactive and user-friendly applications.

### Problem Statement
Write a C program that reads and displays the following data types:
- Character
- Unsigned Character
- Short Integer
- Integer
- Unsigned Integer
- Long Integer
- Unsigned Long Integer
- Unsigned Long Long Integer
- Float
- Double
- Long Double

### Input
The program should prompt the user to input values for each data type.

### Output
Display the input values for each data type.

## About the Problem
The need to interact with users is a common scenario in programming. Whether it's taking user preferences, performing calculations, or displaying results, input and output operations play a crucial role. Efficient I/O handling enhances user experience and streamlines program functionality.

## Approach
To solve the "Basic I/O" problem, we utilize the C programming language's standard input and output functions. We take advantage of functions like `getchar()` and `scanf()` to read input and `printf()` to display output. Our approach involves reading values sequentially for each data type and then displaying them appropriately.

## Code Walkthrough
Let's break down the code into sections and understand each step:

### Input Operations
- We use `getchar()` to read characters and `scanf()` for other data types.
- Carefully handle buffer issues by using additional `getchar()` calls after `getchar()` and `scanf()` to clear any remaining newline characters.

### Output Operations
- We use `printf()` to display the input values for each data type.

## Complexity Analysis
- The time complexity of reading and writing each data type is constant time, O(1).
- The space complexity is also constant, O(1), as we only use a few variables to store input values.

## Examples
Let's consider an example to illustrate the code's functionality:

### Example
```
Enter a character: A
Enter an unsigned character: X
Enter a short integer: 300
Enter an integer: 1500
Enter an unsigned integer: 4294967290
Enter a long integer: 2147483648
Enter an unsigned long integer: 18446744073709551615
Enter an unsigned long long integer: 12345678901234567890
Enter a float: 3.14
Enter a double: 2.71828
Enter a long double: 0.577215

The character is: A
The unsigned character is: X
The short integer is: 300
The integer is: 1500
The unsigned integer is: 4294967290
The long integer is: 2147483648
The unsigned long integer is: 18446744073709551615
The unsigned long long integer is: 12345678901234567890
The float is: 3.140000
The double is: 2.718280
The long double is: 0.577215
```

## Test Cases
Here are additional test cases to verify the code's correctness:

| Input                | Output                |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| A                    | The character is: A   |
| X                    | The unsigned character is: X |
| 123                  | The short integer is: 123 |
| -500                 | The integer is: -500 |
| 4294967295           | The unsigned integer is: 4294967295 |
| 9223372036854775807  | The long integer is: 9223372036854775807 |
| 18446744073709551615 | The unsigned long integer is: 18446744073709551615 |
| 9876543210987654321  | The unsigned long long integer is: 9876543210987654321 |
| 2.718281828459045    | The float is: 2.718282 |
| 3.141592653589793    | The double is: 3.141593 |
| 0.5772156649015329   | The long double is: 0.577216 |

## Troubleshooting
- If input values appear incorrect, ensure that you have provided the correct data type and followed the input format.
- Be cautious of newline characters in the input buffer. Use extra `getchar()` calls to clear them.
