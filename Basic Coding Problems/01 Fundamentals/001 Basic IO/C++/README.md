# Code Guide: Basic I/O

## Introduction
Welcome to the Code Guide for the "Basic I/O" problem. This guide is part of the SharifdotG's CodeVault repository, dedicated to helping fellow learners grasp fundamental programming concepts. In this problem, we'll explore how to perform basic input and output operations in C++.

## Problem Description
The "Basic I/O" problem focuses on reading various data types from the user and displaying them using C++ input/output streams. You will learn how to handle characters, integers, floating-point numbers, and strings.

### Problem Statement
Design a program that reads different types of data from the user, such as characters, integers, floating-point numbers, and strings. After reading each input, display the entered data back to the user.

### Input Specification
The program should prompt the user to input the following:
- A character
- An unsigned character
- A short integer
- An integer
- An unsigned integer
- A long integer
- An unsigned long integer
- An unsigned long long integer
- A float
- A double
- A long double
- A string

### Output Specification
For each input, display the entered data with appropriate labels.

## About the Problem
The need to interact with users and receive input is a fundamental aspect of programming. This problem mirrors real-life scenarios where programs need to gather information from users.

## Approach
To solve this problem, I utilized C++'s standard input and output streams (`cin` and `cout`). These streams allow efficient interaction with the user. I employed appropriate data types to store different kinds of input data.

## Code Walkthrough
### Input
- Use `cin.get()` to read characters.
- Utilize `cin >>` for numeric inputs.
- Use `cin.ignore()` to clear the newline character.
- Utilize `getline(cin, stringVariable)` to read strings.

### Output
- Use `cout <<` to display data with labels.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the code is O(1) for each input operation. The space complexity is also O(1) as we are only storing individual data items.

## Examples
Let's walk through some examples:

Example 1:
```
Enter a character: A
Enter an unsigned character: 66
Enter a short integer: 12345
Enter an integer: 987654321
Enter an unsigned integer: 4294967295
Enter a long integer: 123456789012345
Enter an unsigned long integer: 18446744073709551615
Enter an unsigned long long integer: 12345678901234567890
Enter a float: 3.14
Enter a double: 2.71828
Enter a long double: 0.577215
Enter a string: Hello, CodeVault!

The character is: A
The unsigned character is: B
The short integer is: 12345
The integer is: 987654321
The unsigned integer is: 4294967295
The long integer is: 123456789012345
The unsigned long integer is: 18446744073709551615
The unsigned long long integer is: 12345678901234567890
The float is: 3.14
The double is: 2.71828
The long double is: 0.577215
The string is: Hello, CodeVault!
```

## Test Cases
Here are some additional test cases to validate the code's functionality:
- Test with various numeric values and verify the displayed output.
- Input a string with spaces and special characters.
- Input invalid values and observe error handling.

## Troubleshooting
If the program doesn't wait for input, ensure you are using the correct `cin.ignore()` after numeric inputs.
