# Here is the Code Guide for the Java program to enter the length and width of a rectangle and find its area:

**Problem:**

The problem is to write a program that will allow the user to enter the length and width of a rectangle and then calculate and print the area of the rectangle.

**Code Explanation:**

The code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class rectangle_area {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Get the length and width of the rectangle from the user.
        System.out.print("Enter the length of the rectangle: ");
        int length = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter the width of the rectangle: ");
        int width = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculate the area of the rectangle.
        int area = length * width;

        // Print the area of the rectangle.
        System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is: " + area);
    }
}
```

The first line of code imports the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package. This class will be used to read input from the user.

The next line of code creates a new `Scanner` object. This object will be used to read the length and width of the rectangle from the user.

The next few lines of code get the length and width of the rectangle from the user. The `System.out.print()` method is used to print a prompt to the user. The `scanner.nextInt()` method is used to read an integer from the user.

The next line of code calculates the area of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is equal to the length multiplied by the width.

The final line of code prints the area of the rectangle. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print a message to the user.

**Conclusion:**

This code guide has explained the problem and the code in detail. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment in the repository.
