# Here is the Code Guide for the program to enter the length and width of a rectangle and find its area:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that will allow the user to enter the length and width of a rectangle, and then calculate and display the area of the rectangle.

**Code Explanation**

The code for this problem is as follows:

```c
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int length, width, area;

    cout << "Enter the length of the rectangle: ";
    cin >> length;

    cout << "Enter the width of the rectangle: ";
    cin >> width;

    area = length * width;

    cout << "The area of the rectangle is: " << area << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code, `#include <iostream>`, tells the compiler to include the `iostream` header file. This header file contains the definition of the `cout` and `cin` objects, which are used to output and input data to the console.

The next line of code, `using namespace std;`, tells the compiler to use the `std` namespace. This namespace contains all of the standard library functions, including `cout` and `cin`.

The next three lines of code, `int length, width, area;`, declare three variables of type `int`. These variables will be used to store the length, width, and area of the rectangle.

The next four lines of code,
```c
cout << "Enter the length of the rectangle: ";
cin >> length;

cout << "Enter the width of the rectangle: ";
cin >> width;
```
prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle. The `cout` object is used to output the text to the console, and the `cin` object is used to input data from the console.

The next line of code, `area = length * width;`, calculates the area of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is equal to the length times the width.

The next line of code,
```c
cout << "The area of the rectangle is: " << area << endl;
```
outputs the area of the rectangle to the console.

The last line of code, `return 0;`, tells the compiler that the program has successfully completed.

**Conclusion**

This Code Guide has provided a detailed explanation of the program to enter the length and width of a rectangle and find its area. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment in the repository.
