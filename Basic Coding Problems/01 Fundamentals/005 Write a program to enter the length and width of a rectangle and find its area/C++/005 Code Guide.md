## Understanding the Problem

The problem is to write a C++ program to enter the length and width of a rectangle and find its area. The area of a rectangle is the length times the width. For example, if the length is 5 and the width is 4, then the area is 5 * 4 = 20.

## Approaching the Problem

The first step is to define the variables that will be used to store the length, width, and area of the rectangle. The next step is to prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle. Then, the length and width should be read from the user. The area of the rectangle can then be calculated by multiplying the length and width. Finally, the area of the rectangle should be printed to the console.

## Solving the Problem

The code below solves the problem:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

  // The length of the rectangle.
  int length;

  // The width of the rectangle.
  int width;

  // The area of the rectangle.
  int area;

  // Prompts the user to enter the length of the rectangle.
  cout << "Enter the length of the rectangle: ";

  // Reads the length of the rectangle from the user.
  cin >> length;

  // Prompts the user to enter the width of the rectangle.
  cout << "Enter the width of the rectangle: ";

  // Reads the width of the rectangle from the user.
  cin >> width;

  // Calculates the area of the rectangle.
  area = length * width;

  // Prints the area of the rectangle.
  cout << "The area of the rectangle is: " << area << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This code first defines three variables: `length`, `width`, and `area`. The `length` and `width` variables are used to store the length and width of the rectangle, respectively. The `area` variable is used to store the area of the rectangle.

The next step is to prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle. This is done using the `cout` object. The `cin` object is then used to read the length and width from the user.

The area of the rectangle is then calculated by multiplying the `length` and `width` variables. This is done using the `*` operator.

Finally, the area of the rectangle is printed to the console using the `cout` object.
