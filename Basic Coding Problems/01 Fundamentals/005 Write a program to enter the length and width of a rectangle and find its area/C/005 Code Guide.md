# Here is the Code Guide for the program to find the area of a rectangle:

## The Problem

The problem is to write a program that enters the length and width of a rectangle and finds its area. The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width.

## Code Explanation

The code is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int length, width, area;

    printf("Enter the length of the rectangle: ");
    scanf("%d", &length);

    printf("Enter the width of the rectangle: ");
    scanf("%d", &width);

    area = length * width;

    printf("The area of the rectangle is: %d\n", area);

    return 0;
}
```

The first line, `#include <stdio.h>`, tells the compiler to include the `stdio.h` header file, which contains the definitions for the `printf()` and `scanf()` functions.

The next line, `int main() {`, defines the `main()` function, which is the entry point for the program.

The following three lines, `int length, width, area;`, declare three integer variables: `length`, `width`, and `area`. The `length` variable will store the length of the rectangle, the `width` variable will store the width of the rectangle, and the `area` variable will store the area of the rectangle.

The next two lines,

```c
printf("Enter the length of the rectangle: ");
scanf("%d", &length);
```

prompt the user to enter the length of the rectangle and then read the user's input into the `length` variable.

The next two lines,

```c
printf("Enter the width of the rectangle: ");
scanf("%d", &width);
```

prompt the user to enter the width of the rectangle and then read the user's input into the `width` variable.

The next line,

```c
area = length * width;
```

calculates the area of the rectangle and stores it in the `area` variable.

The next line,

```c
printf("The area of the rectangle is: %d\n", area);
```

prints the area of the rectangle to the console.

The last line, `return 0;`, returns the value `0` from the `main()` function, which indicates that the program terminated successfully.
