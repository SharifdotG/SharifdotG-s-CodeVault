# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that will:

1. Get the length and width of a rectangle from the user.
2. Calculate the area of the rectangle.
3. Display the area of the rectangle.

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length and width. For example, if the length of a rectangle is 10 and the width is 5, then the area is 10 * 5 = 50.

To solve this problem, you will need to use the following programming concepts:

* Input/output
* Variables
* Arithmetic operations
* Conditional statements
* Loops

Here is an algorithm for solving this problem:

1. Get the length and width of the rectangle from the user.
2. Calculate the area of the rectangle.
3. Display the area of the rectangle.

Here is a pseudocode for solving this problem:

```
# Get the length and width of the rectangle from the user.
length = input("Enter the length of the rectangle: ")
width = input("Enter the width of the rectangle: ")

# Calculate the area of the rectangle.
area = length * width

# Display the area of the rectangle.
print("The area of the rectangle is", area)
```

I hope this Code Hint helps you solve the problem!
