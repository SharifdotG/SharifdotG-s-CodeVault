# Code Guide: Arithmetic Operations

## Introduction
Welcome to the Code Guide for the "Arithmetic Operations" problem. This guide is a part of SharifdotG's CodeVault repository, aimed at helping learners understand and master coding concepts. In this guide, I will walk you through the problem of performing basic arithmetic operations on two numbers and explain the code implementation step by step.

## Problem Description
This problem involves taking two numbers as input and performing various arithmetic operations on them. The operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (integer division), and finding the remainder. The goal is to compute and display the results of these operations.

**Input**: Two integer numbers, separated by a space.
**Output**: Results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder.

## About the Problem
Arithmetic operations are fundamental in mathematics and everyday life. They are used for tasks ranging from simple calculations to complex scientific and engineering computations. For instance, when managing finances, calculating quantities, or analyzing data trends, arithmetic operations play a crucial role.

## Approach
I approached this problem by first accepting two integer numbers as input using the `input` function. I then performed each arithmetic operation as required and stored the results in separate variables. Finally, I displayed the results using the `print` function.

### Algorithm:
1. Accept two integer numbers using `input` and split them.
2. Compute the sum of the numbers and store it in the `sum` variable.
3. Compute the difference of the numbers and store it in the `difference` variable.
4. Compute the product of the numbers and store it in the `product` variable.
5. Compute the quotient (integer division) of the numbers and store it in the `quotient` variable.
6. Compute the remainder of the division and store it in the `remainder` variable.
7. Display each result using `print`.

## Code Walkthrough
```python
# Accept two numbers as input
firstNumber, secondNumber = map(int, input("Enter two numbers: ").split())

# Perform arithmetic operations
sum = firstNumber + secondNumber
difference = firstNumber - secondNumber
product = firstNumber * secondNumber
quotient = firstNumber // secondNumber
remainder = firstNumber % secondNumber

# Display results
print("Sum:", sum)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Product:", product)
print("Quotient:", quotient)
print("Remainder:", remainder)
```

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1) because the arithmetic operations are constant-time operations. The space complexity is also O(1) as only a few extra variables are used.

## Examples
Let's walk through some examples to see the code in action:

Example 1:
- Input: 5 3
- Sum: 8, Difference: 2, Product: 15, Quotient: 1, Remainder: 2

Example 2:
- Input: -10 2
- Sum: -8, Difference: -12, Product: -20, Quotient: -5, Remainder: 0

## Test Cases
Here are a few test cases to validate the code:

1. Input: 10 2
   - Expected Output: Sum: 12, Difference: 8, Product: 20, Quotient: 5, Remainder: 0

2. Input: 0 7
   - Expected Output: Sum: 7, Difference: -7, Product: 0, Quotient: 0, Remainder: 0

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using this code, make sure you provide valid integer inputs. If the second number is 0, the division and remainder operations might lead to errors.
