# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that can enter two numbers and perform all arithmetic operations on them. The arithmetic operations that you need to perform are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

To solve this problem, you will need to first define two variables to store the two numbers that the user will enter. You can then use the arithmetic operators to perform the desired operations on the two numbers. For example, to add the two numbers, you would use the following code:

```
int firstNumber = 10;
int secondNumber = 20;

int sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
```

Once you have performed all of the desired operations, you can then print the results to the console.

Here is an algorithm for solving this problem:

1. Get two numbers from the user.
2. Perform all arithmetic operations on the two numbers.
3. Print the results to the console.

Here is a pseudocode for solving this problem:

```
procedure arithmeticOperations(firstNumber, secondNumber)
  sum := firstNumber + secondNumber
  difference := firstNumber - secondNumber
  product := firstNumber * secondNumber
  quotient := firstNumber / secondNumber
  remainder := firstNumber % secondNumber
  print(sum, difference, product, quotient, remainder)
end procedure
```

I hope this helps!
