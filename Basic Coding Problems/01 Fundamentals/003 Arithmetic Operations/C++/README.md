# Code Guide: Arithmetic Operations

## Introduction:
Welcome to the Code Guide for the problem **Arithmetic Operations**. This guide is part of the repository "SharifdotG's CodeVault," a collection of categorized codes aimed at aiding fellow learners in their programming journey. This guide will help you understand how to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers and provide detailed explanations for each step of the code.

## Problem Description:
The problem is about performing five arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus) on two given numbers and displaying the results. The input consists of two integers, and the output includes the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder of these numbers.

**Input:**
- Two integers representing the numbers to perform operations on.

**Output:**
- Sum of the two numbers.
- Difference of the two numbers.
- Product of the two numbers.
- Quotient when the first number is divided by the second number.
- Remainder when the first number is divided by the second number.

## About the Problem:
The concept of performing arithmetic operations on numbers is fundamental in mathematics and programming. These operations are used extensively in various applications such as calculations, simulations, and data analysis.

## Approach:
The approach taken to solve this problem involves taking input for two numbers, performing each arithmetic operation step by step, and then displaying the results. The algorithm is straightforward and doesn't require any complex data structures.

## Code Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the code step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int firstNumber, secondNumber;

    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> firstNumber >> secondNumber;

    int sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
    int difference = firstNumber - secondNumber;
    int product = firstNumber * secondNumber;
    int quotient = firstNumber / secondNumber;
    int remainder = firstNumber % secondNumber;

    cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;
    cout << "Difference: " << difference << endl;
    cout << "Product: " << product << endl;
    cout << "Quotient: " << quotient << endl;
    cout << "Remainder: " << remainder << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of this code is constant, O(1), as it performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations regardless of the input values. The space complexity is also constant, as only a few integer variables are used.

## Examples:
Let's consider some examples:

**Example 1:**
Input: 
```
Enter two numbers: 10 3
```
Output:
```
Sum: 13
Difference: 7
Product: 30
Quotient: 3
Remainder: 1
```

**Example 2:**
Input: 
```
Enter two numbers: 25 5
```
Output:
```
Sum: 30
Difference: 20
Product: 125
Quotient: 5
Remainder: 0
```

## Test Cases:
1. Input: 0 0
   Output: Sum: 0, Difference: 0, Product: 0, Quotient: Error (division by zero), Remainder: Error (division by zero)
   
2. Input: -7 3
   Output: Sum: -4, Difference: -10, Product: -21, Quotient: -2, Remainder: -1

## Troubleshooting:
- **Issue:** Division by zero might lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.
  **Solution:** Check if the second number is not zero before performing division and modulus.
