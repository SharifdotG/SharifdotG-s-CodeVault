## Problem

The problem is to write a program that enters two numbers and performs all arithmetic operations on them. The arithmetic operations that the program should perform are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

## Code Explanation

The code for the program is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int firstNumber, secondNumber;

    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> firstNumber >> secondNumber;

    int sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
    int difference = firstNumber - secondNumber;
    int product = firstNumber * secondNumber;
    int quotient = firstNumber / secondNumber;
    int remainder = firstNumber % secondNumber;

    cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;
    cout << "Difference: " << difference << endl;
    cout << "Product: " << product << endl;
    cout << "Quotient: " << quotient << endl;
    cout << "Remainder: " << remainder << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code, `#include <iostream>`, includes the `iostream` header file, which contains the `cout` and `cin` objects that are used to print and read data from the console.

The next line of code, `using namespace std;`, tells the compiler that we are using the `std` namespace, which contains all of the standard C++ library functions.

The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It first declares two variables, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`, to store the two numbers that the user will enter.

The next line of code, `cout << "Enter two numbers: ";`, prompts the user to enter two numbers. The `cin >>` operator then reads the two numbers from the console and stores them in the `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` variables.

The next few lines of code calculate the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder of the two numbers. The `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` operators are used to perform the arithmetic operations.

The final few lines of code print the results of the arithmetic operations to the console.
