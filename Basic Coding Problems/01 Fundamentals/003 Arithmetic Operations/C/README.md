# Code Guide: Arithmetic Operations

## Introduction
Welcome to the Code Guide for the "Arithmetic Operations" problem from SharifdotG's CodeVault repository. In this guide, I will walk you through the step-by-step process of understanding and solving the problem related to basic arithmetic operations. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of the code, making it easier for learners to grasp the underlying concepts.

## Problem Description
The "Arithmetic Operations" problem involves performing basic arithmetic operations on two input numbers and displaying the results. The operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and finding the remainder. The goal is to calculate and output the results of these operations.

**Input:** Two integers - the first and second numbers.
**Output:** The sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder of the two numbers.

## About the Problem
Arithmetic operations are fundamental in mathematics and have various real-life applications, such as calculating expenses, distances, quantities, and more. These operations are used extensively in programming to manipulate numerical data.

## Approach
The approach taken to solve the "Arithmetic Operations" problem involves using basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) to calculate the desired values. The algorithm takes the input numbers, performs the operations, and then outputs the results.

## Code Walkthrough
Let's break down the provided code step by step:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int firstNumber, secondNumber;

    // Taking user input
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &firstNumber, &secondNumber);

    // Performing arithmetic operations
    int sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
    int difference = firstNumber - secondNumber;
    int product = firstNumber * secondNumber;
    int quotient = firstNumber / secondNumber;
    int remainder = firstNumber % secondNumber;

    // Displaying results
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    printf("Difference: %d\n", difference);
    printf("Product: %d\n", product);
    printf("Quotient: %d\n", quotient);
    printf("Remainder: %d\n", remainder);

    return 0;
}
```

Here's what the code does:

1. The user is prompted to enter two numbers.
2. The code reads these two numbers using the `scanf` function.
3. The sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder are calculated using arithmetic operators.
4. The results are displayed using the `printf` function.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this algorithm is constant, O(1), as the calculations and outputs are not dependent on the input size. The space complexity is also constant, as only a few variables are used to store the results.

## Examples
Let's walk through an example:
**Input:** 10 3
**Output:**
```
Sum: 13
Difference: 7
Product: 30
Quotient: 3
Remainder: 1
```

## Test Cases
Here are some additional test cases to validate the code:

1. **Input:** 15 5
   **Output:**
   ```
   Sum: 20
   Difference: 10
   Product: 75
   Quotient: 3
   Remainder: 0
   ```

2. **Input:** 8 2
   **Output:**
   ```
   Sum: 10
   Difference: 6
   Product: 16
   Quotient: 4
   Remainder: 0
   ```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while using this code, ensure that you provide valid input (integers) for both numbers. Be cautious when dividing by zero, as it will result in an error.
