# Code Guide: Arithmetic Operations

## Introduction:
Welcome to the Code Guide for the "Arithmetic Operations" problem from the SharifdotG's CodeVault repository. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of arithmetic operations through a step-by-step breakdown of the provided code. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this guide will help you grasp the concepts and techniques used in the code.

## Problem Description:
The "Arithmetic Operations" problem involves performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus) on two input numbers and displaying the results.

### Problem Statement:
Given two integers, calculate and display their sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder.

### Input:
Two integer numbers (divisor should not be zero).

### Output:
Print the results of the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder calculations.

## About the Problem:
Arithmetic operations are fundamental in programming and real-world applications. They are used for calculations in various fields, from finance to physics.

## Approach:
The code takes two integer inputs, performs arithmetic operations, and displays the results.

### Algorithm:
1. Read two integer inputs.
2. Calculate the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder using appropriate operators.
3. Display the results.

## Code Walkthrough:
Let's dive into the code step by step:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Step 1: Read two integer inputs
        System.out.print("Enter two numbers: ");
        int firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();
        int secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        // Step 2: Perform arithmetic operations
        int sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
        int difference = firstNumber - secondNumber;
        int product = firstNumber * secondNumber;
        int quotient = firstNumber / secondNumber;
        int remainder = firstNumber % secondNumber;

        // Step 3: Display the results
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        System.out.println("Difference: " + difference);
        System.out.println("Product: " + product);
        System.out.println("Quotient: " + quotient);
        System.out.println("Remainder: " + remainder);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of this code is constant (O(1)) since it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also constant, as it only uses a few integer variables.

## Examples:
Let's consider a few examples to understand the code's execution:

**Example 1:**
Input:
```
Enter two numbers: 10 3
```
Output:
```
Sum: 13
Difference: 7
Product: 30
Quotient: 3
Remainder: 1
```

**Example 2:**
Input:
```
Enter two numbers: -8 2
```
Output:
```
Sum: -6
Difference: -10
Product: -16
Quotient: -4
Remainder: 0
```

## Test Cases:
1. Input: 5 2
   Expected Output: Sum: 7, Difference: 3, Product: 10, Quotient: 2, Remainder: 1
2. Input: 0 7
   Expected Output: Sum: 7, Difference: -7, Product: 0, Quotient: 0, Remainder: 0

## Troubleshooting:
If you encounter any "division by zero" errors, ensure that the second input is not zero.
