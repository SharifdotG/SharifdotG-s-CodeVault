# Here is the Code Guide for the program to calculate the area of an equilateral triangle:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that calculates the area of an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle is a triangle with all three sides of equal length. The area of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the following formula:

```c
area = (sqrt(3) / 4) * side * side
```

where `side` is the length of one side of the triangle.

**Code Explanation**

The code for the program is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    float side, area;

    printf("Enter the side of the equilateral triangle: ");
    scanf("%f", &side);

    area = (sqrt(3) / 4) * side * side;

    printf("The area of the equilateral triangle is: %f\n", area);

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code includes the `stdio.h` header file, which contains the `printf()` and `scanf()` functions. The second line includes the `math.h` header file, which contains the `sqrt()` function.

The `main()` function is the starting point of the program. The first line of the `main()` function prompts the user to enter the side of the equilateral triangle. The second line of the `main()` function reads the user's input and stores it in the `side` variable.

The third line of the `main()` function calculates the area of the equilateral triangle using the formula given above. The `sqrt()` function is used to calculate the square root of 3.

The fourth line of the `main()` function prints the area of the equilateral triangle to the console.

The last line of the `main()` function returns the value 0, which indicates that the program has successfully completed.

**Conclusion**

This Code Guide has explained the problem and the code for the program to calculate the area of an equilateral triangle. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment on the repository.
