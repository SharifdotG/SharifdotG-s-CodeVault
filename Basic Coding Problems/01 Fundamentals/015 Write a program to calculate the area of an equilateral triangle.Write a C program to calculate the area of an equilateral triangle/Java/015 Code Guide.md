# Here is the Code Guide for the Java program to calculate the area of an equilateral triangle:

**The Problem**

An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. The area of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the following formula:

```java
area = (√3)/4 * side^2
```

where `side` is the length of one side of the triangle.

**Code Explanation**

The code to calculate the area of an equilateral triangle is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class equilateral_triangle {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the side of the equilateral triangle: ");
        float side = scanner.nextFloat();

        float area = (float) (Math.sqrt(3) / 4) * side * side;

        System.out.println("The area of the equilateral triangle is: " + area);
    }
}
```

The first line imports the `java.util.Scanner` class, which is used to read input from the user. The next line creates a new `Scanner` object and assigns it to the variable `scanner`.

The next line prompts the user to enter the side of the equilateral triangle. The user's input is stored in the variable `side`.

The next line calculates the area of the equilateral triangle using the formula `(√3)/4 * side^2`. The result is stored in the variable `area`.

The final line prints the area of the equilateral triangle to the console.

**Conclusion**

This code can be used to calculate the area of an equilateral triangle. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment in the repository.
