# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program to calculate the area of an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle is a triangle with all three sides of equal length. The area of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the following formula:

```
area = (sqrt(3) / 4) * side^2
```

where `side` is the length of one side of the triangle.

To solve this problem, you will need to:

1. Get the length of one side of the triangle from the user.
2. Calculate the area of the triangle using the formula above.
3. Print the area of the triangle to the console.

Here is an algorithm for solving this problem:

```
1. Get the length of one side of the triangle from the user.
2. Calculate the area of the triangle using the formula `area = (sqrt(3) / 4) * side^2`.
3. Print the area of the triangle to the console.
```

Here is a pseudocode for solving this problem:

```
procedure calculate_area_of_equilateral_triangle(side)
  area = (sqrt(3) / 4) * side^2
  print(area)
end procedure
```

I hope this helps!
