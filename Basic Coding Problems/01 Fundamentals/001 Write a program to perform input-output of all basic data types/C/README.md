**CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!**

The following code prompts the user to enter a value for each of the basic data types, and then prints the values that were entered. The basic data types in C are:

* char
* unsigned char
* short
* int
* unsigned int
* long
* unsigned long
* unsigned long long
* float
* double
* long double

The code uses the `printf()` and `scanf()` functions to read and write data from the console. The `printf()` function is used to display a prompt on the console, and the `scanf()` function is used to read a value from the console and store it in a variable.

To run the code, you can save it as a `.c` file and then compile and run it using a C compiler.

**Here are some tips and tricks for solving this problem:**

* When declaring variables, be sure to use the correct data type for each value that you will be storing.
* When using the `printf()` function, be sure to use the correct format specifier for each data type.
* When using the `scanf()` function, be sure to specify the address of the variable where the value will be stored.

I hope this helps!
