## Understanding the problem

The problem statement asks you to write a C++ program to perform input/output of all basic data types. This means that you need to create variables of each of the basic data types, prompt the user to enter a value for each variable, and then print the value that was entered.

## Approaching the problem

Here is a possible approach to solving the problem:

1. First, you need to include the `iostream` header file.
2. Next, you need to declare variables of each of the basic data types.
3. Then, you need to prompt the user to enter a value for each variable.
4. Then, you need to use the `cin` object to read the user's input and store it in the corresponding variable.
5. Finally, you need to use the `cout` object to print the value that was entered.

## Solving the problem

Here is the C++ code that solves the problem:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

  // Declare variables of each of the basic data types.
  char charVal;
  unsigned char unsignedCharVal;
  short shortVal;
  int intVal;
  unsigned int unsignedIntVal;
  long longVal;
  unsigned long unsignedLongVal;
  unsigned long long unsignedLongLongVal;
  float floatVal;
  double doubleVal;
  long double longDoubleVal;

  // Prompt the user to enter a value for each of the basic data types.
  cout << "Enter a character: ";
  cin >> charVal;

  cout << "Enter an unsigned character: ";
  cin >> unsignedCharVal;

  cout << "Enter a short integer: ";
  cin >> shortVal;

  cout << "Enter an integer: ";
  cin >> intVal;

  cout << "Enter an unsigned integer: ";
  cin >> unsignedIntVal;

  cout << "Enter a long integer: ";
  cin >> longVal;

  cout << "Enter an unsigned long integer: ";
  cin >> unsignedLongVal;

  cout << "Enter an unsigned long long integer: ";
  cin >> unsignedLongLongVal;

  cout << "Enter a float: ";
  cin >> floatVal;

  cout << "Enter a double: ";
  cin >> doubleVal;

  cout << "Enter a long double: ";
  cin >> longDoubleVal;

  // Print the values that were entered.
  cout << "\nThe character is: " << charVal << endl;
  cout << "The unsigned character is: " << unsignedCharVal << endl;
  cout << "The short integer is: " << shortVal << endl;
  cout << "The integer is: " << intVal << endl;
  cout << "The unsigned integer is: " << unsignedIntVal << endl;
  cout << "The long integer is: " << longVal << endl;
  cout << "The unsigned long integer is: " << unsignedLongVal << endl;
  cout << "The unsigned long long integer is: " << unsignedLongLongVal << endl;
  cout << "The float is: " << floatVal << endl;
  cout << "The double is: " << doubleVal << endl;
  cout << "The long double is: " << longDoubleVal << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

## Testing the code

You can test the code by compiling and running it. When you run the code, it will prompt you to enter a value for each of the basic data types. After you enter a value for each data type, the code will print the value that you entered.

I hope this helps!

Here are some additional notes that you may find helpful:

* The `iostream` header file is required to use the `cin` and `cout` objects.
* The `using namespace std` statement is used to shorten the names of the `cin` and `cout` objects.
* The `endl` manipulator is used to insert a newline character at the end of the output.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
