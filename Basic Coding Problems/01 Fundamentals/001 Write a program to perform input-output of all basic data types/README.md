# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Name: Hello World

### Problem Description:
I'm presenting you with a classic "Hello World" challenge. Your task is to write a program that takes no input and prints the famous phrase "Hello, World!" to the console. This is a fundamental starting point in any programming language.

### Example Input and Output:
Example 1:
Input: None
Output: Hello, World!

### Constraints:
- You should not take any input for this challenge.
- The output must exactly match the provided example.

### Understand the Problem:
To tackle this problem, break it down into simpler components. Consider:
- What's the main goal of the program?
- What should the program take as input, if anything?
- What should the program output?
- How can you achieve this output using code?

### Plan the Approach:
A simple approach involves using the print function to display the desired message. Think about the syntax and conventions of the programming language you're using.

### Algorithm:
1. Open a new code file.
2. Write the necessary code to print "Hello, World!" to the console.
3. Ensure that the syntax is correct and the code is ready for execution.

### Pseudocode:
```
START
    PRINT "Hello, World!"
END
```

### Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
Input: None
Output: Hello, World!

### Additional Guidance:
Remember, this is a foundational challenge. Focus on understanding the basic structure of the code and the logic behind it. Experiment with different variations to deepen your understanding.
