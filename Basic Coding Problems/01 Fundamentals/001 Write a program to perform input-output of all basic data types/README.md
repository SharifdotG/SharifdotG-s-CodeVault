**CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!**

This problem asks you to write a program that can perform input and output of all basic data types. The basic data types in C, C++, and Java are:

* **Character** (char)
* **Integer** (int)
* **Unsigned integer** (unsigned int)
* **Long integer** (long)
* **Unsigned long integer** (unsigned long)
* **Float** (float)
* **Double** (double)
* **Long double** (long double)

The program should first prompt the user to enter a value for each data type. Then, the program should print the value that the user entered.

Here is an example of how the program might work:

```
Enter a character: a
Enter an integer: 1234
Enter an unsigned integer: 123456789
Enter a long integer: 123456789012345
Enter an unsigned long integer: 1234567890123456789
Enter a float: 1.2345
Enter a double: 1.23456789
Enter a long double: 1.234567890123456789
```

The program should then print the values that the user entered, one per line. For example, the output might look like this:

```
The character is: a
The integer is: 1234
The unsigned integer is: 123456789
The long integer is: 123456789012345
The unsigned long integer is: 1234567890123456789
The float is: 1.2345
The double is: 1.23456789
The long double is: 1.234567890123456789
```

The program should be written in a way that is easy to understand and modify. The code should be well-formatted and commented.

Here are some additional tips for writing the program:

* Use a consistent style throughout the code.
* Use meaningful variable names.
* Use comments to explain the code.
* Test the program thoroughly.

I hope this Code Hint helps you to write a program that can perform input and output of all basic data types.
