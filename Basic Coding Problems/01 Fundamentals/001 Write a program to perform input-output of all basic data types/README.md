# Code Guide: Calculate Profit or Loss

## Introduction:
Welcome to the repository containing various problem-solving codes! This guide will walk you through the problem "Calculate Profit or Loss" and explain the provided C code step-by-step. The code aims to determine whether a transaction results in a profit or loss based on the cost price and selling price.

## Problem Description:
The problem is to calculate the profit or loss incurred in a transaction. It takes two inputs:
- `costPrice`: The cost price of an item.
- `sellingPrice`: The selling price of the same item.

The goal is to determine whether the transaction results in a profit or a loss and the amount of profit or loss.

## Approach:
The approach used in this code is straightforward. It involves calculating the difference between the selling price and the cost price to find out whether there is a profit or a loss. Depending on the outcome, the code will display the corresponding result.

Algorithm:
1. Read the `costPrice` and `sellingPrice` from the user.
2. Check if `sellingPrice` is greater than `costPrice`.
    - If true, calculate profit as `sellingPrice - costPrice`.
    - If false, check if `costPrice` is greater than `sellingPrice`.
        - If true, calculate loss as `costPrice - sellingPrice`.
3. Display the result based on the calculated profit or loss.

## Code Walkthrough:
Let's now dive into the code and understand each part in detail:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int costPrice, sellingPrice, profit = 0, loss = 0;

    printf("Enter the cost price: ");
    scanf("%d", &costPrice);

    printf("Enter the selling price: ");
    scanf("%d", &sellingPrice);

    if (sellingPrice > costPrice) {
        profit = sellingPrice - costPrice;
    } else if (costPrice > sellingPrice) {
        loss = costPrice - sellingPrice;
    }

    if (profit > 0) {
        printf("Profit is %d\n", profit);
    } else if (loss > 0) {
        printf("Loss is %d\n", loss);
    } else {
        printf("No profit no loss\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

1. The code starts by including the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`).

2. It then defines the `main()` function, which is the entry point of the program.

3. Two variables `costPrice` and `sellingPrice` are declared to store the user-input values for the cost and selling prices, respectively. Two more variables `profit` and `loss` are initialized to zero, which will be used to store the calculated profit and loss amounts.

4. The program prompts the user to enter the cost price using `printf()` and reads the input using `scanf()`.

5. Similarly, the program prompts the user to enter the selling price and reads the input.

6. Next, the code checks if `sellingPrice` is greater than `costPrice`. If this condition is true, it means there is a profit, and the profit amount is calculated as `sellingPrice - costPrice` and stored in the `profit` variable.

7. If the condition in step 6 is false, the code checks if `costPrice` is greater than `sellingPrice`. If true, it means there is a loss, and the loss amount is calculated as `costPrice - sellingPrice` and stored in the `loss` variable.

8. After calculating profit or loss, the code proceeds to display the result using `printf()`. If `profit` is greater than zero, it prints the profit amount. If `loss` is greater than zero, it prints the loss amount. If both `profit` and `loss` are zero, it prints "No profit no loss."

9. The `main()` function returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program.

## Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of this code is constant, O(1), as it only involves basic arithmetic operations and conditional checks, which take a constant amount of time regardless of the input size. Similarly, the space complexity is also O(1) as the program uses a fixed number of variables.

The solution is efficient, and there are no specific areas for improvement since the problem is straightforward.

## Examples:
Let's walk through a few examples to demonstrate the code's execution and output.

Example 1:
```
Enter the cost price: 100
Enter the selling price: 120
```
Output:
```
Profit is 20
```

Example 2:
```
Enter the cost price: 150
Enter the selling price: 100
```
Output:
```
Loss is 50
```

Example 3:
```
Enter the cost price: 200
Enter the selling price: 200
```
Output:
```
No profit no loss
```

## Test Cases:
Here are some test cases to validate the code. For each test case, we will provide the inputs and the expected output.

Test Case 1:
```
Input: 
Cost Price = 50
Selling Price = 70

Expected Output:
Profit is 20
```

Test Case 2:
```
Input: 
Cost Price = 80
Selling Price = 60

Expected Output:
Loss is 20
```

Test Case 3:
```
Input: 
Cost Price = 120
Selling Price = 120

Expected Output:
No profit no loss
```

## Troubleshooting:
- **Issue**: The user enters non-integer values for cost price or selling price.
  - **Solution**: Add input validation to ensure the user enters valid integer values. Check for non-numeric characters and handle them accordingly.
