# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that can input and output all of the basic data types in a programming language. The basic data types are typically integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and Booleans.

To solve this problem, you will need to understand how to use the input and output statements in your programming language. You will also need to understand the syntax for declaring variables of each of the basic data types.

Here are some examples of how to input and output the basic data types in different programming languages:

* In Python, you can use the `input()` function to input a value from the user, and the `print()` function to output a value to the console.
* In Java, you can use the `Scanner` class to input a value from the user, and the `System.out.println()` method to output a value to the console.
* In C++, you can use the `cin` and `cout` objects to input and output values, respectively.

Here is an algorithm for solving this problem:

1. Declare variables of each of the basic data types.
2. Prompt the user to enter a value for each variable.
3. Use the input statements to read the values from the user.
4. Use the output statements to print the values to the console.

Here is a pseudocode for solving this problem:

```
DECLARE
  int i;
  float f;
  string s;
  boolean b;

INPUT
  i = readInteger();
  f = readFloat();
  s = readString();
  b = readBoolean();

OUTPUT
  printInteger(i);
  printFloat(f);
  printString(s);
  printBoolean(b);
```

I hope this Code Hint helps you solve the problem!
