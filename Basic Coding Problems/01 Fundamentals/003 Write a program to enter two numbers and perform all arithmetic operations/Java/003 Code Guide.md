# Here is the Code Guide for the program to enter two numbers and perform all arithmetic operations:

**Problem:**

The problem is to write a program that allows the user to enter two numbers and then performs all the basic arithmetic operations on those numbers. The operations that should be performed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder.

**Code Explanation:**

The code for the program is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class arithmetic {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter two numbers: ");
        int firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();
        int secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        int sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
        int difference = firstNumber - secondNumber;
        int product = firstNumber * secondNumber;
        int quotient = firstNumber / secondNumber;
        int remainder = firstNumber % secondNumber;

        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        System.out.println("Difference: " + difference);
        System.out.println("Product: " + product);
        System.out.println("Quotient: " + quotient);
        System.out.println("Remainder: " + remainder);
    }
}
```

The first step in the code is to import the `java.util.Scanner` class. This class allows us to read input from the user.

The next step is to create a `Scanner` object. This object is used to read the two numbers that the user enters.

The next step is to perform the arithmetic operations on the two numbers. The `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` operators are used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder, respectively.

The final step is to print the results of the arithmetic operations to the console.

**Conclusion:**

This code guide has explained how the program to enter two numbers and perform all arithmetic operations works. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment on the repository.

**Additional Information:**

The `java.util.Scanner` class has a number of other methods that can be used to read input from the user. For example, the `nextLine()` method can be used to read a line of text from the user.

The `System.out.println()` method can be used to print text to the console. The `println()` method also adds a new line to the console after the text is printed.

The `%` operator can also be used to find the modulus of two numbers. The modulus of two numbers is the remainder that is left when one number is divided by the other number.

I hope this helps!
