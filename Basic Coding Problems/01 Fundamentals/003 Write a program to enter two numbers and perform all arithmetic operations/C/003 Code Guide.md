Sure, here is the Code Guide for the problem "Write a program to enter two numbers and perform all arithmetic operations."

**The Problem**

This problem asks us to write a program that will allow the user to enter two numbers, and then perform all of the arithmetic operations on those numbers. The operations that we need to perform are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder.

**Code Explanation**

The code for this problem is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int first_number, second_number;

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &first_number, &second_number);

    int sum = first_number + second_number;
    int difference = first_number - second_number;
    int product = first_number * second_number;
    int quotient = first_number / second_number;
    int remainder = first_number % second_number;

    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    printf("Difference: %d\n", difference);
    printf("Product: %d\n", product);
    printf("Quotient: %d\n", quotient);
    printf("Remainder: %d\n", remainder);

    return 0;
}
```

The first step in the code is to declare two variables, `first_number` and `second_number`. These variables will store the two numbers that the user enters.

The next step is to prompt the user to enter the two numbers. This is done using the `printf()` function. The `printf()` function takes two arguments: the first argument is the text that we want to display to the user, and the second argument is the variable that we want to store the user's input in.

Once the user has entered the two numbers, we can perform the arithmetic operations on them. We do this using the following code:

```c
int sum = first_number + second_number;
int difference = first_number - second_number;
int product = first_number * second_number;
int quotient = first_number / second_number;
int remainder = first_number % second_number;
```

This code uses the arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` to perform the addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder operations on the two numbers.

The final step in the code is to print the results of the arithmetic operations to the user. This is done using the `printf()` function again.

**Conclusion**

This code guide has explained how to write a program that will allow the user to enter two numbers, and then perform all of the arithmetic operations on those numbers. The code for this problem is simple and easy to understand, and it can be used as a starting point for learning how to write arithmetic operations in C.
