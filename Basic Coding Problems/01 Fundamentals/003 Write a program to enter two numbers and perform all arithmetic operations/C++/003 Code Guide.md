# Here is the Code Guide for the C++ code:

# Here are some guidelines on how to understand, approach, and solve the problem:

## Understand the problem

The first step is to understand the problem. What are you being asked to do? In this case, you are being asked to write a C++ program that will:

1. Enter two numbers from the user.
2. Perform all arithmetic operations on the two numbers.
3. Print the results of the arithmetic operations.

## Approach the problem

Once you understand the problem, you need to approach it in a systematic way. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. Declare the variables you will need. In this case, you will need two variables to store the two numbers entered by the user.
2. Prompt the user for two numbers. You can use the `std::cout` object to print a prompt and the `std::cin` object to read the user's input.
3. Calculate the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder of the two numbers. You can use the `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` operators to perform these operations.
4. Print the results of the arithmetic operations. You can use the `std::cout` object to print the results.

## Solve the problem

Now that you have a plan, you can start coding. Here is the complete code for the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    // Declare variables.
    int a, b;

    // Prompt the user for two numbers.
    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> a >> b;

    // Calculate the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder of the two numbers.
    int sum = a + b;
    int difference = a - b;
    int product = a * b;
    int quotient = a / b;
    int remainder = a % b;

    // Print the results.
    cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;
    cout << "Difference: " << difference << endl;
    cout << "Product: " << product << endl;
    cout << "Quotient: " << quotient << endl;
    cout << "Remainder: " << remainder << endl;

    // Return 0 to indicate success.
    return 0;
}
```

## If you have any queries, you can comment in the repository.

Here are some additional notes about the code:

* The `using namespace std;` statement is used to import all the names from the `std` namespace into the current scope. This makes it easier to refer to the `cout` and `cin` objects.
* The `cout << "Enter two numbers: ";` statement is used to print a prompt to the user. The `<<` operator is used to insert text into the output stream.
* The `cin >> a >> b;` statement is used to read two numbers from the user. The `>>` operator is used to extract data from the input stream.
* The `sum = a + b;` statement is used to calculate the sum of the two numbers. The `+` operator is used to add two numbers.
* The `cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;` statement is used to print the sum of the two numbers. The `endl` manipulator is used to insert a newline character into the output stream.

I hope this helps!
