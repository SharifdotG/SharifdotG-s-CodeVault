# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The conversion formula is:

```
Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
```

To solve this problem, you will need to:

1. Get the temperature in Celsius from the user.
2. Calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit using the conversion formula.
3. Display the temperature in Fahrenheit to the user.

Here is an algorithm for the problem:

```
1. Get the temperature in Celsius from the user.
2. Calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit using the conversion formula.
3. Display the temperature in Fahrenheit to the user.
```

Here is a pseudocode for the problem:

```
procedure convert_temperature(celsius)
  fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
  print(fahrenheit)
end procedure
```

I hope this helps!
