# Here is the Code Guide for your Java program to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that will enter a temperature in Celsius and convert it into Fahrenheit. The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

```java
Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
```

**Code Explanation**

The code for this problem is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class convert_celsius_to_fahrenheit {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter temperature in Celsius: ");
        float celsius = scanner.nextFloat();

        float fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;

        System.out.printf("Temperature in Fahrenheit: %.2f\n", fahrenheit);
    }
}
```

The first line imports the `Scanner` class, which will be used to read the temperature in Celsius from the user. The next line creates a new `Scanner` object.

The third line prompts the user to enter the temperature in Celsius. The fourth line reads the temperature from the user and stores it in a variable named `celsius`.

The fifth line calculates the Fahrenheit equivalent of the Celsius temperature. The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is used to calculate the Fahrenheit temperature.

The sixth line prints the Fahrenheit temperature to the console. The `printf()` method is used to format the output so that it is displayed with two decimal places.

**Conclusion**

This code guide has explained how to write a Java program to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. The code is highly detailed and concise, so that everyone can understand it without any issues. If you have any queries, please feel free to comment in the repository.

**Additional Notes**

* The `Scanner` class is a useful class for reading input from the user. It can be used to read a variety of different types of input, including integers, floats, and strings.
* The `printf()` method is a formatting method that is used to format the output of a program. It can be used to format the output so that it is displayed in a specific way.
* The `System.out` object is used to output data to the console.
