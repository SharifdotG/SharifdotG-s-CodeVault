# Here is the guideline for the problem:

## Understanding the problem

The problem is to write a C++ program to enter temperature in Celsius and convert it into Fahrenheit. The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

```
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9.0 / 5.0) + 32;
```

The program should prompt the user to enter the temperature in Celsius, then calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit and print it to the console.

## Approaching the problem

The first step is to declare the variables that will be used in the program. These variables are:

* `celsius`: The temperature in Celsius.
* `fahrenheit`: The temperature in Fahrenheit.

The next step is to prompt the user to enter the temperature in Celsius. This can be done using the `std::cout` object.

```
std::cout << "Enter temperature in Celsius: ";
```

The next step is to read the temperature from the user. This can be done using the `std::cin` object.

```
std::cin >> celsius;
```

The next step is to calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit. This can be done using the following code:

```
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9.0 / 5.0) + 32;
```

The final step is to print the temperature in Fahrenheit to the console. This can be done using the `std::cout` object.

```
std::cout << "Temperature in Fahrenheit: " << fahrenheit << std::endl;
```

## Solving the problem

The complete code for the program is shown below:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {

  float celsius;
  float fahrenheit;

  std::cout << "Enter temperature in Celsius: ";
  std::cin >> celsius;

  fahrenheit = (celsius * 9.0 / 5.0) + 32;

  std::cout << "Temperature in Fahrenheit: " << fahrenheit << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
