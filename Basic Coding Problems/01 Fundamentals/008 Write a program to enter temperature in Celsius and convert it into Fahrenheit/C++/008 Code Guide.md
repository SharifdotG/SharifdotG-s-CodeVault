# Here is the Code Guide for the program to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that takes a temperature in Celsius as input and converts it to Fahrenheit. The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

```c++
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
```

**Code Explanation**

The code for the program is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    float celsius, fahrenheit;

    cout << "Enter temperature in Celsius: ";
    cin >> celsius;

    fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;

    cout << "Temperature in Fahrenheit: " << fixed << setprecision(2) << fahrenheit << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code includes the `iostream` and `iomanip` libraries. These libraries are used for input and output, respectively.

The next line of code uses the `using namespace std` statement to make the `std` namespace accessible. This namespace contains all of the standard C++ library functions.

The `main()` function is the entry point for the program. It first declares two variables, `celsius` and `fahrenheit`. The `celsius` variable will store the temperature in Celsius, and the `fahrenheit` variable will store the temperature in Fahrenheit.

The next line of code prompts the user to enter the temperature in Celsius. The user's input is stored in the `celsius` variable.

The next line of code calculates the temperature in Fahrenheit. The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is used to calculate the value of `fahrenheit`.

The next line of code prints the temperature in Fahrenheit to the console. The `fixed` and `setprecision(2)` manipulators are used to format the output so that it is displayed with two decimal places.

The last line of code returns 0 to the operating system, indicating that the program terminated successfully.

**Conclusion**

This code guide provides a detailed explanation of the program to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment in the repository.
