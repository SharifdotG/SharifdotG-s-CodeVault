# Here is the Code Guide for the problem of converting Fahrenheit to Celsius in C language:

## The Problem

The problem is to write a program that will enter a temperature in Fahrenheit and convert it into Celsius. The formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is:

```c
°C = (°F - 32) * 5 / 9
```

## Code Explanation

The code for this problem is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float fahrenheit, celsius;

    printf("Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: ");
    scanf("%f", &fahrenheit);

    celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;

    printf("The temperature in Celsius is: %.2f\n", celsius);

    return 0;
}
```

The first step in the code is to declare two variables, `fahrenheit` and `celsius`. `fahrenheit` will store the temperature in Fahrenheit, and `celsius` will store the temperature in Celsius.

The next step is to prompt the user to enter the temperature in Fahrenheit. This is done with the following line of code:

```c
printf("Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: ");
```

The user's input is then stored in the `fahrenheit` variable.

The next step is to calculate the temperature in Celsius. This is done with the following line of code:

```c
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
```

This line of code uses the formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius to calculate the value of `celsius`.

The final step is to print the temperature in Celsius to the console. This is done with the following line of code:

```c
printf("The temperature in Celsius is: %.2f\n", celsius);
```

This line of code uses the `printf()` function to print the value of `celsius` to the console, with two decimal places.

## Conclusion

This code is a simple way to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius in C language. The code is highly detailed and concise, so that everyone can understand it without any issues. If you have any queries, please feel free to comment in the repository.
