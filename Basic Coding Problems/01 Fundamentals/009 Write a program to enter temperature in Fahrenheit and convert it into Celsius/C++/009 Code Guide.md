# Here is the Code Guide for the C++ code:

**Understanding the problem**

The problem asks you to write a C++ program to enter temperature in Fahrenheit and convert it into Celsius. The first step to solving any problem is to understand it. In this case, we need to understand the following:

* What is the input for the program?
* What is the output for the program?
* What is the formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius?

The input for the program is the temperature in Fahrenheit. The output for the program is the temperature in Celsius. The formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is:

```c++
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
```

**Approaching the problem**

Once we understand the problem, we can start to approach it. The first step is to define the variables that we will need. In this case, we will need two variables:

* `fahrenheit`: This variable will store the temperature in Fahrenheit.
* `celsius`: This variable will store the temperature in Celsius.

The next step is to write the code to prompt the user to enter the temperature in Fahrenheit. We can do this using the `std::cout` object.

```c++
std::cout << "Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: ";
```

The next step is to read the temperature from the user. We can do this using the `std::cin` object.

```c++
std::cin >> fahrenheit;
```

The next step is to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. We can do this using the following formula:

```c++
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
```

The final step is to print the temperature in Celsius. We can do this using the `std::cout` object.

```c++
std::cout << "The temperature in Celsius is: " << celsius << std::endl;
```

**Solving the problem**

Now that we have a plan, we can start to solve the problem. The following code shows the complete solution:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    float fahrenheit, celsius;

    cout << "Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: ";
    cin >> fahrenheit;

    celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;

    cout << "The temperature in Celsius is: " << celsius << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
