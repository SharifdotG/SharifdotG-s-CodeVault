# Here is the Code Guide for the temperature conversion program in Fahrenheit and Celsius:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that will convert a temperature entered in Fahrenheit to Celsius. The formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is:

```
C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9
```

where C is the temperature in Celsius and F is the temperature in Fahrenheit.

**Code Explanation**

The code for the temperature conversion program is as follows:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    float fahrenheit, celsius;

    cout << "Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: ";
    cin >> fahrenheit;

    celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;

    cout << "The temperature in Celsius is: " << fixed << setprecision(2) << celsius << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code includes the `iostream` and `iomanip` header files. These header files contain the declarations for the `cout` and `cin` objects, which are used to output and input data, respectively.

The next line of code uses the `using namespace std;` directive to bring the names of all the objects and functions in the `std` namespace into the current scope. This saves us from having to write `std::cout` and `std::cin` every time we want to use those objects.

The `main()` function is the entry point for the program. It first declares two variables, `fahrenheit` and `celsius`, to store the temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius, respectively.

The next line of code uses the `cout` object to prompt the user to enter the temperature in Fahrenheit. The `cin` object is then used to read the user's input and store it in the `fahrenheit` variable.

The next line of code calculates the temperature in Celsius using the formula given above.

The last line of code uses the `cout` object to output the temperature in Celsius. The `fixed` manipulator is used to format the output so that it has two decimal places. The `setprecision()` manipulator is used to set the precision of the output to two decimal places.

**Conclusion**

This concludes the Code Guide for the temperature conversion program in Fahrenheit and Celsius. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment in the repository.
