# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that will convert a temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius. The formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is:

```
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
```

For example, if the temperature in Fahrenheit is 212 degrees, then the temperature in Celsius is 100 degrees.

To solve this problem, you will need to:

1. Get the temperature in Fahrenheit from the user.
2. Calculate the temperature in Celsius using the formula above.
3. Print the temperature in Celsius.

Here is an algorithm for solving the problem:

```
1. Get the temperature in Fahrenheit from the user.
2. Calculate the temperature in Celsius using the formula above.
3. Print the temperature in Celsius.
```

Here is a pseudocode for solving the problem:

```
procedure convert_fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit)
  temperature_in_celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
  print temperature_in_celsius
end procedure
```

I hope this helps!
