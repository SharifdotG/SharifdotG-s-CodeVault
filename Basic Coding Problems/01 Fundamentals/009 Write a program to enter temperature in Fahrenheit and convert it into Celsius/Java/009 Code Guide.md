# Here is the code guide for the temperature conversion program:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that will enter a temperature in Fahrenheit and convert it into Celsius. The formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is:

```java
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
```

**Code Explanation**

The code for the temperature conversion program is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class temperature_conversion {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: ");
        float fahrenheit = scanner.nextFloat();

        float celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;

        System.out.println("The temperature in Celsius is: " + celsius);
    }
}
```

The first line of code imports the `java.util.Scanner` class, which will be used to read the user's input. The next line of code creates a `Scanner` object and assigns it to the variable `scanner`.

The next few lines of code prompt the user to enter the temperature in Fahrenheit and then store the user's input in the variable `fahrenheit`.

The next line of code calculates the Celsius equivalent of the temperature in Fahrenheit. The formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is used to calculate the value of `celsius`.

The last line of code prints the temperature in Celsius to the console.

**Conclusion**

This code guide has explained the problem and the code for the temperature conversion program. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment in the repository.

**Additional Notes**

* The `Scanner` class is a useful class for reading user input. It can be used to read input from the console, files, or other sources.
* The `nextFloat()` method of the `Scanner` class is used to read a floating-point number from the console.
* The `println()` method of the `System` class is used to print a string to the console.
