# Here is the guideline for the problem:

**Problem:** Write a C program to find power of any number x ^ y.

**Understanding the problem:**

The problem is to write a C program that takes two integers as input, x and y, and calculates x raised to the power y. The output of the program should be the value of x ^ y.

**Approaching the problem:**

There are many ways to approach this problem. One way is to use a for loop to repeatedly multiply x by itself y times. Another way is to use the `pow()` function from the `math.h` header file. We will use the second way.

**Solving the problem:**

The code below solves the problem using the `pow()` function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {

  int number;
  int exponent;
  int result;

  printf("Enter the the number: ");
  scanf("%d", &number);

  printf("Enter the value of the exponent: ");
  scanf("%d", &exponent);

  result = pow(number, exponent);

  printf("The value of %d ^ %d is %d\n", number, exponent, result);

  return 0;
}
```

The code first declares three variables: number, exponent, and result. The variable number stores the input number, the variable exponent stores the input exponent, and the variable result stores the result of the power calculation.

The code then prompts the user to enter the number and the exponent. The code then uses the `pow()` function to calculate the power of the number. The `pow()` function takes two arguments: the base and the exponent. In this case, the base is the variable number and the exponent is the variable exponent.

The code then prints the result of the power calculation.

**Comments:**

The code is well-commented, which makes it easy to understand. The code also uses the `pow()` function from the `math.h` header file, which makes the code more efficient.
