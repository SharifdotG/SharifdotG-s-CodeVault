# Here is the Code Guide for the program to count the total number of notes in a given amount:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that takes an amount of money as input and outputs the number of notes of each denomination that are required to make up that amount. For example, if the input is 1230, the output should be:

```java
The number of 500 notes is: 2
The number of 200 notes is: 0
The number of 100 notes is: 1
The number of 50 notes is: 1
The number of 20 notes is: 1
The number of 10 notes is: 3
The number of 5 notes is: 0
The number of 2 notes is: 0
The number of 1 notes is: 0
```

**Code Explanation**

The code to solve this problem is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class count_notes {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the amount: ");
        int amount = scanner.nextInt();

        int notesOf500 = amount / 500;
        amount %= 500;

        int notesOf200 = amount / 200;
        amount %= 200;

        int notesOf100 = amount / 100;
        amount %= 100;

        int notesOf50 = amount / 50;
        amount %= 50;

        int notesOf20 = amount / 20;
        amount %= 20;

        int notesOf10 = amount / 10;
        amount %= 10;

        int notesOf5 = amount / 5;
        amount %= 5;

        int notesOf2 = amount / 2;
        amount %= 2;

        int notesOf1 = amount;

        System.out.println("The number of 500 notes is: " + notesOf500);
        System.out.println("The number of 200 notes is: " + notesOf200);
        System.out.println("The number of 100 notes is: " + notesOf100);
        System.out.println("The number of 50 notes is: " + notesOf50);
        System.out.println("The number of 20 notes is: " + notesOf20);
        System.out.println("The number of 10 notes is: " + notesOf10);
        System.out.println("The number of 5 notes is: " + notesOf5);
        System.out.println("The number of 2 notes is: " + notesOf2);
        System.out.println("The number of 1 notes is: " + notesOf1);
    }
}
```

The code first declares a variable `amount` to store the input amount. Then, it uses a series of `if` statements to determine the number of notes of each denomination. For example, the following code determines the number of 500 notes:

```java
int notesOf500 = amount / 500;
```

This code first divides the `amount` variable by 500. If the result is an integer, then there is one 500 note. Otherwise, there are no 500 notes.

The code then repeats this process for each denomination of note. Finally, the code prints out the number of notes of each denomination.

**Conclusion**

This code successfully solves the problem of counting the total number of notes in a given amount. The code is well-organized and easy to understand. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment in the repository.
