# Here is the code guide for the problem of counting the total number of notes in a given amount:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that takes an amount of money as input and outputs the number of notes of each denomination required to make up that amount. For example, if the input is 1000, the output should be 2 notes of 500, 0 notes of 200, 0 notes of 100, 1 note of 50, 0 notes of 20, 0 notes of 10, 0 notes of 5, 0 notes of 2, and 1 note of 1.

**Code Explanation**

The code to solve this problem is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int amount;
    int notes_of_500, notes_of_200, notes_of_100, notes_of_50, notes_of_20, notes_of_10, notes_of_5, notes_of_2, notes_of_1;

    printf("Enter the amount: ");
    scanf("%d", &amount);

    notes_of_500 = amount / 500;
    amount %= 500;

    notes_of_200 = amount / 200;
    amount %= 200;

    notes_of_100 = amount / 100;
    amount %= 100;

    notes_of_50 = amount / 50;
    amount %= 50;

    notes_of_20 = amount / 20;
    amount %= 20;

    notes_of_10 = amount / 10;
    amount %= 10;

    notes_of_5 = amount / 5;
    amount %= 5;

    notes_of_2 = amount / 2;
    amount %= 2;

    notes_of_1 = amount;

    printf("The number of 500 notes is: %d\n", notes_of_500);
    printf("The number of 200 notes is: %d\n", notes_of_200);
    printf("The number of 100 notes is: %d\n", notes_of_100);
    printf("The number of 50 notes is: %d\n", notes_of_50);
    printf("The number of 20 notes is: %d\n", notes_of_20);
    printf("The number of 10 notes is: %d\n", notes_of_10);
    printf("The number of 5 notes is: %d\n", notes_of_5);
    printf("The number of 2 notes is: %d\n", notes_of_2);
    printf("The number of 1 notes is: %d\n", notes_of_1);

    return 0;
}
```

The code first declares a number of variables to store the number of notes of each denomination. Then, it prompts the user to enter the amount of money. Next, it uses a series of `if` statements to calculate the number of notes of each denomination. For example, the following code calculates the number of 500-rupee notes:

```c
notes_of_500 = amount / 500;
```

This code first divides the amount by 500. If the result is an integer, then the number of 500-rupee notes is equal to the result. Otherwise, the number of 500-rupee notes is equal to the largest integer less than the result.

Finally, the code prints the number of notes of each denomination.

**Conclusion**

This code can be used to count the total number of notes in a given amount. It is a simple and efficient solution to the problem. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment in the repository.
