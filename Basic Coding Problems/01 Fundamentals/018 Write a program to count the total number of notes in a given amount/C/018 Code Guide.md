# Here is the guideline for the coding problem:

**Understanding the problem**

The problem is to write a C program to count the total number of notes in a given amount. The amount can be in any denomination, such as 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, or 1.

**Approaching the problem**

The problem can be solved by first prompting the user to enter the amount of money. Then, the program can calculate the number of notes of each denomination by dividing the amount by the denomination and taking the remainder. Finally, the program can print the number of notes of each denomination.

**Solving the problem**

The code below solves the problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int amount;
  int note_500, note_200, note_100, note_50, note_20, note_10, note_5, note_2, note_1;

  printf("Enter the amount: ");
  scanf("%d", &amount);

  note_500 = amount / 500;
  amount %= 500;

  note_200 = amount / 200;
  amount %= 200;

  note_100 = amount / 100;
  amount %= 100;

  note_50 = amount / 50;
  amount %= 50;

  note_20 = amount / 20;
  amount %= 20;

  note_10 = amount / 10;
  amount %= 10;

  note_5 = amount / 5;
  amount %= 5;

  note_2 = amount / 2;
  amount %= 2;

  note_1 = amount / 1;

  printf("The number of 500 notes is: %d\n", note_500);
  printf("The number of 200 notes is: %d\n", note_200);
  printf("The number of 100 notes is: %d\n", note_100);
  printf("The number of 50 notes is: %d\n", note_50);
  printf("The number of 20 notes is: %d\n", note_20);
  printf("The number of 10 notes is: %d\n", note_10);
  printf("The number of 5 notes is: %d\n", note_5);
  printf("The number of 2 notes is: %d\n", note_2);
  printf("The number of 1 notes is: %d\n", note_1);

  return 0;
}
```

**Explaining the code**

The code first defines the variables that will be used to store the number of notes of each denomination. Then, the program prompts the user to enter the amount of money. The `amount` variable is then assigned the value entered by the user.

The next part of the code calculates the number of notes of each denomination. This is done by dividing the `amount` variable by the denomination and taking the remainder. For example, to calculate the number of 500 notes, the code would use the following line:

```c
note_500 = amount / 500;
```

This line divides the `amount` variable by 500 and stores the result in the `note_500` variable. The remainder is then discarded.

The final part of the code prints the number of notes of each denomination. This is done by using the `printf()` function. For example, to print the number of 500 notes, the code would use the following line:

```c
printf("The number of 500 notes is: %d\n", note_500);
```

This line prints the value of the `note_500` variable, followed by a newline character.
