# Here is the Code Guide for the program to count the total number of notes in a given amount:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that takes an amount of money as input and prints the number of notes of each denomination that make up the amount. For example, if the input is 1230, the program should print the following:

```c++
The number of 500 notes is: 2
The number of 200 notes is: 0
The number of 100 notes is: 1
The number of 50 notes is: 1
The number of 20 notes is: 1
The number of 10 notes is: 3
The number of 5 notes is: 0
The number of 2 notes is: 0
The number of 1 notes is: 0
```

**Code Explanation**

The code for the program is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int amount;
    int notes_of_500, notes_of_200, notes_of_100, notes_of_50, notes_of_20, notes_of_10, notes_of_5, notes_of_2, notes_of_1;

    cout << "Enter the amount: ";
    cin >> amount;

    notes_of_500 = amount / 500;
    amount %= 500;

    notes_of_200 = amount / 200;
    amount %= 200;

    notes_of_100 = amount / 100;
    amount %= 100;

    notes_of_50 = amount / 50;
    amount %= 50;

    notes_of_20 = amount / 20;
    amount %= 20;

    notes_of_10 = amount / 10;
    amount %= 10;

    notes_of_5 = amount / 5;
    amount %= 5;

    notes_of_2 = amount / 2;
    amount %= 2;

    notes_of_1 = amount;

    cout << "The number of 500 notes is: " << notes_of_500 << endl;
    cout << "The number of 200 notes is: " << notes_of_200 << endl;
    cout << "The number of 100 notes is: " << notes_of_100 << endl;
    cout << "The number of 50 notes is: " << notes_of_50 << endl;
    cout << "The number of 20 notes is: " << notes_of_20 << endl;
    cout << "The number of 10 notes is: " << notes_of_10 << endl;
    cout << "The number of 5 notes is: " << notes_of_5 << endl;
    cout << "The number of 2 notes is: " << notes_of_2 << endl;
    cout << "The number of 1 notes is: " << notes_of_1 << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The code first declares a number of variables to store the number of notes of each denomination. Then, it prompts the user to enter the amount of money. The amount is then divided by the value of each denomination to find the number of notes of that denomination. The results are then printed to the console.

**Conclusion**

This code is a simple way to count the total number of notes in a given amount. It can be easily modified to include more denominations or to print the results in a different format. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment on the repository.
