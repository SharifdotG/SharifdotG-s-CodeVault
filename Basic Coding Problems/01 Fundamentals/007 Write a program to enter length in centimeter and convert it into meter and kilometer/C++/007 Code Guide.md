# Here is the Code Guide for the centimeter to meter and kilometer conversion program:

**Problem:**

The problem is to write a program that converts a length entered in centimeters to meters and kilometers.

**Code Explanation:**

The code is written in C++ and uses the following libraries:

* `iostream` for input and output
* `iomanip` for formatting output

The main function of the program first declares three variables:

* `length_in_cm` to store the length entered by the user in centimeters
* `length_in_m` to store the length in meters
* `length_in_km` to store the length in kilometers

The next step is to prompt the user to enter the length in centimeters. This is done using the following code:

```c++
cout << "Enter the length in centimeter: ";
cin >> length_in_cm;
```

Once the length has been entered, the program converts it to meters and kilometers using the following code:

```c++
length_in_m = length_in_cm / 100.0;
length_in_km = length_in_cm / 100000.0;
```

The final step is to print the results to the console. This is done using the following code:

```c++
cout << "The length in meter is: " << fixed << setprecision(2) << length_in_m << endl;
cout << "The length in kilometer is: " << fixed << setprecision(2) << length_in_km << endl;
```

The `fixed` and `setprecision` manipulators are used to format the output to two decimal places.

**Conclusion:**

This concludes the Code Guide for the centimeter to meter and kilometer conversion program. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment in the repository.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code can be easily modified to convert lengths entered in other units, such as inches or feet.
* The code can also be modified to print the results in different formats, such as scientific notation or engineering notation.
* The code can be used as a starting point for other projects that require length conversion.
