## Understanding the problem

The problem is to write a C++ program that takes the length in centimeter as input and converts it into meter and kilometer. The conversion formulas for centimeter to meter and kilometer are:

* 1 centimeter = 0.01 meter
* 1 centimeter = 0.00001 kilometer

## Approaching the problem

The first step is to include the `iostream` header file. This header file contains the definition of the `cout` and `cin` objects, which are used to print and read data from the console.

The next step is to define the variables that will be used in the program. These variables are:

* `centimeter`: The length in centimeter
* `meter`: The length in meter
* `kilometer`: The length in kilometer

The next step is to prompt the user to enter the length in centimeter. This can be done using the `cout` object.

```c++
cout << "Enter the length in centimeter: ";
```

The next step is to read the length in centimeter from the user. This can be done using the `cin` object.

```c++
cin >> centimeter;
```

Once the length in centimeter has been read from the user, the next step is to convert it into meter and kilometer. This can be done using the following code:

```c++
meter = centimeter / 100.0;
kilometer = centimeter / 100000.0;
```

Finally, the length in meter and kilometer should be printed to the console. This can be done using the `cout` object.

```c++
cout << "The length in meter is: " << meter << endl;
cout << "The length in kilometer is: " << kilometer << endl;
```

## Solving the problem

The complete code for the problem is shown below:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    int centimeter;
    float meter, kilometer;

    cout << "Enter the length in centimeter: ";
    cin >> centimeter;

    meter = centimeter / 100.0;
    kilometer = centimeter / 100000.0;

    cout << "The length in meter is: " << meter << endl;
    cout << "The length in kilometer is: " << kilometer << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
