# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that can convert a length in centimeters into meters and kilometers. To do this, you will need to first input the length in centimeters from the user. Then, you will need to calculate the equivalent length in meters and kilometers. Finally, you will need to output the results to the user.

Here are some tips and tricks for solving this problem:

* Remember that 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters.
* To convert a length in centimeters to meters, simply divide the length by 100.
* To convert a length in centimeters to kilometers, divide the length by 1,000,000.

Here is an algorithm for solving this problem:

1. Input the length in centimeters from the user.
2. Calculate the equivalent length in meters.
3. Calculate the equivalent length in kilometers.
4. Output the results to the user.

Here is a pseudocode for solving this problem:

```
input length_in_centimeters
length_in_meters = length_in_centimeters / 100
length_in_kilometers = length_in_centimeters / 1,000,000
output length_in_meters, length_in_kilometers
```

I hope this Code Hint helps you solve the problem!
