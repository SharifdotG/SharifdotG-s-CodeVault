# Here is the Code Guide for the problem of converting centimeters to meters and kilometers:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that will accept a length in centimeters as input and then convert it to meters and kilometers. The program should print the results to the console.

**Code Explanation**

The code for this problem is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int length_in_cm;
    float length_in_m, length_in_km;

    printf("Enter the length in centimeter: ");
    scanf("%d", &length_in_cm);

    length_in_m = length_in_cm / 100.0;
    length_in_km = length_in_cm / 100000.0;

    printf("The length in meter is: %.2f\n", length_in_m);
    printf("The length in kilometer is: %.2f\n", length_in_km);

    return 0;
}
```

The first step in the code is to declare the variables that will be used. These variables are `length_in_cm`, `length_in_m`, and `length_in_km`. `length_in_cm` will store the length in centimeters as entered by the user. `length_in_m` will store the length in meters, and `length_in_km` will store the length in kilometers.

The next step is to prompt the user to enter the length in centimeters. This is done with the following line of code:

```c
printf("Enter the length in centimeter: ");
```

The user will then enter the length in centimeters, and this value will be stored in the `length_in_cm` variable.

The next step is to calculate the length in meters and kilometers. This is done with the following lines of code:

```c
length_in_m = length_in_cm / 100.0;
length_in_km = length_in_cm / 100000.0;
```

The `length_in_m` variable is calculated by dividing the `length_in_cm` variable by 100.0. This is because there are 100 centimeters in one meter. The `length_in_km` variable is calculated by dividing the `length_in_cm` variable by 100000.0. This is because there are 100000 centimeters in one kilometer.

The final step in the code is to print the results to the console. This is done with the following lines of code:

```c
printf("The length in meter is: %.2f\n", length_in_m);
printf("The length in kilometer is: %.2f\n", length_in_km);
```

The first line of code prints the length in meters to the console. The second line of code prints the length in kilometers to the console. The `%.2f` format specifier tells the `printf()` function to print the value with two decimal places.
