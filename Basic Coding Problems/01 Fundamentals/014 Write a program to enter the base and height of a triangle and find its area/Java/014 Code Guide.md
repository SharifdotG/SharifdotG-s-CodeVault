# Here is the code guide for the Java program to find the area of a triangle:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that enters the base and height of a triangle and finds its area. The area of a triangle is equal to half the product of its base and height.

**Code Explanation**

The code for this problem is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class triangle_area {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the base of the triangle: ");
        float base = scanner.nextFloat();

        System.out.print("Enter the height of the triangle: ");
        float height = scanner.nextFloat();

        float area = (float) 0.5 * base * height;

        System.out.printf("The area of the triangle is: %.2f\n", area);
    }
}
```

The first line imports the `Scanner` class, which is used to read user input. The next line defines the `triangle_area` class, which contains the main method. The main method starts by creating a new `Scanner` object. Then, it prompts the user to enter the base and height of the triangle. The user input is stored in the `base` and `height` variables.

The next line calculates the area of the triangle. The area is equal to half the product of the base and height, so the following expression is used to calculate the area:

```java
float area = (float) 0.5 * base * height;
```

The final line of code prints the area of the triangle to the console. The `printf` method is used to format the output so that it is displayed to two decimal places.

**Conclusion**

This code guide has explained how to write a Java program to find the area of a triangle. The code is highly detailed and concise, so that everyone can understand it without any issues. If you have any queries, please feel free to comment in the repository.
