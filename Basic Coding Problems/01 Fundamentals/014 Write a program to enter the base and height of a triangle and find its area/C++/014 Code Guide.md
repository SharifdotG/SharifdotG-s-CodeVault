# Here is the code guide for the triangle area program in C++:

**Problem:**

The problem is to write a program that enters the base and height of a triangle and finds its area. The area of a triangle is equal to half the product of its base and height.

**Code Explanation:**

The code for the triangle area program is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    float base, height, area;

    cout << "Enter the base of the triangle: ";
    cin >> base;

    cout << "Enter the height of the triangle: ";
    cin >> height;

    area = 0.5 * base * height;

    cout << "The area of the triangle is: " << fixed << setprecision(2) << area << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code includes the `iostream` and `iomanip` libraries. These libraries are used for input and output operations.

The next line of code uses the `using namespace std;` statement to make the `cout` and `cin` objects available without having to prefix them with the `std::` namespace.

The `main()` function is the entry point for the program. It declares three variables: `base`, `height`, and `area`. The `base` and `height` variables are used to store the base and height of the triangle, respectively. The `area` variable is used to store the area of the triangle.

The next few lines of code get the base and height of the triangle from the user. The `cout` object is used to print a prompt to the user. The `cin` object is used to read the user's input.

The next line of code calculates the area of the triangle. The area is equal to half the product of the base and height. The `0.5` constant is used to multiply the base and height by 0.5.

The next line of code prints the area of the triangle to the console. The `cout` object is used to print the area. The `fixed` and `setprecision(2)` manipulators are used to format the output so that it shows two decimal places.

The last line of code returns 0 from the `main()` function. This indicates that the program terminated successfully.

**Conclusion:**

This code guide provides a detailed explanation of the triangle area program in C++. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment on the repository.
