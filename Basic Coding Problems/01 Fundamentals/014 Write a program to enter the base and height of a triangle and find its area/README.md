# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program to enter the base and height of a triangle and find its area. The area of a triangle is equal to one half the product of its base and height.

For example, if the base of a triangle is 10 units and its height is 5 units, then its area is 50 square units.

To solve this problem, you will need to:

1. Prompt the user to enter the base and height of the triangle.
2. Calculate the area of the triangle using the formula: area = (1/2) * base * height.
3. Display the area of the triangle to the user.

Here is an algorithm for solving this problem:

1. **Initialize variables.**
    * base = 0
    * height = 0
    * area = 0
2. **Prompt the user to enter the base and height of the triangle.**
    * base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
    * height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))
3. **Calculate the area of the triangle.**
    area = (1/2) * base * height
4. **Display the area of the triangle to the user.**
    print("The area of the triangle is", area, "square units.")

Here is a pseudocode for solving this problem:

```
ALGORITHM FindTriangleArea

INPUT: base, height
OUTPUT: area

BEGIN
  area := 0
  area := (1/2) * base * height
  PRINT area
END
```
