# Here are some guidelines for understanding, approaching, and solving the problem:

## Understanding the problem

The first step is to understand the problem. What are you being asked to do? In this case, you are being asked to write a C++ program that will enter two numbers and find their sum.

## Approaching the problem

Once you understand the problem, you need to decide how you are going to approach it. There are many different ways to solve this problem, but one possible approach is to use the following steps:

1. Declare three variables: `a`, `b`, and `sum`.
2. Prompt the user to enter the first number.
3. Read the first number from the user.
4. Prompt the user to enter the second number.
5. Read the second number from the user.
6. Calculate the sum of the two numbers.
7. Print the sum of the two numbers.

## Solving the problem

Here is the code that implements the above approach:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    int a, b, sum;

    cout << "Enter the first number: ";
    cin >> a;

    cout << "Enter the second number: ";
    cin >> b;

    sum = a + b;

    cout << "The sum of the two numbers is: " << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Commenting your code

It is always a good idea to comment your code. This will help you and others understand what your code is doing. Here is a commented version of the above code:

```c++
/*
 * This program enters two numbers and finds their sum.
 */

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

/*
 * Declare three variables.
 */
int a, b, sum;

/*
 * Prompt the user to enter the first number.
 */
cout << "Enter the first number: ";

/*
 * Read the first number from the user.
 */
cin >> a;

/*
 * Prompt the user to enter the second number.
 */
cout << "Enter the second number: ";

/*
 * Read the second number from the user.
 */
cin >> b;

/*
 * Calculate the sum of the two numbers.
 */
sum = a + b;

/*
 * Print the sum of the two numbers.
 */
cout << "The sum of the two numbers is: " << sum << endl;

/*
 * Return 0 on success, non-zero on error.
 */
return 0;
```
