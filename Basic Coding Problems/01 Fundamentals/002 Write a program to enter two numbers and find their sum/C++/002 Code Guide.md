# Here is the Code Guide for the program to enter two numbers and find their sum:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that enters two numbers and finds their sum. The program should first prompt the user to enter the two numbers. Then, the program should add the two numbers and display the sum.

**Code Explanation**

The code for the program is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int first_number, second_number, sum;

    cout << "Enter the first number: ";
    cin >> first_number;

    cout << "Enter the second number: ";
    cin >> second_number;

    sum = first_number + second_number;

    cout << "The sum of the two numbers is: " << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code, `#include <iostream>`, includes the `iostream` header file, which contains the `cout` and `cin` objects that are used to output and input data. The next line of code, `using namespace std;`, tells the compiler to use the `std` namespace, which contains all of the standard C++ library functions.

The `main()` function is the entry point for the program. The first line of the `main()` function, `int first_number, second_number, sum;`, declares three integer variables: `first_number`, `second_number`, and `sum`. The `first_number` and `second_number` variables are used to store the two numbers that the user enters. The `sum` variable is used to store the sum of the two numbers.

The next three lines of code,

```c++
cout << "Enter the first number: ";
cin >> first_number;

cout << "Enter the second number: ";
cin >> second_number;
```

prompt the user to enter the two numbers. The `cout` object is used to output text to the console. The `cin` object is used to input data from the console.

The next line of code,

```c++
sum = first_number + second_number;
```

adds the two numbers and stores the result in the `sum` variable.

The last line of code,

```c++
cout << "The sum of the two numbers is: " << sum << endl;
```

displays the sum of the two numbers.

**Conclusion**

This Code Guide has explained the problem and the code for the program to enter two numbers and find their sum. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment on the repository.
