# Code Guide: Sum of Two Numbers

## Introduction:
Welcome to the Code Guide for the "Sum of Two Numbers" problem. This repository contains solutions to various coding problems, each categorized neatly for easy reference. The purpose of this guide is to help readers understand the problem, the code implementation, and the approach used to find the sum of two numbers.

## Problem Description:
The "Sum of Two Numbers" problem aims to find the sum of two input numbers. The program takes two integer inputs from the user and computes their sum. The problem can be summarized as follows:

### Problem Statement:
Write a program to enter two numbers and find their sum.

### Input:
The program takes two integer inputs, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`, which are entered by the user.

### Output:
The program calculates the sum of `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` and displays the result as follows:
```
The sum of the two numbers is: [sum]
```

## Approach:
To solve the "Sum of Two Numbers" problem, we use a straightforward approach. The algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. **Input**: Accept two integer inputs, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`, from the user using a scanner.
2. **Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` and store it in a variable named `sum`.
3. **Output**: Display the result by printing "The sum of the two numbers is: [sum]" to the console.

## Code Walkthrough:
Let's break down the code into logical sections and understand each part step-by-step:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SumOfTwoNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Input
        int firstNumber, secondNumber, sum;

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        // Step 2: Sum Calculation
        sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;

        // Step 3: Output
        System.out.println("The sum of the two numbers is: " + sum);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis:
The time and space complexity of the "Sum of Two Numbers" algorithm is constant or O(1). This is because the number of operations and memory used remains the same regardless of the input values. The solution is highly efficient and doesn't require any iteration or recursion.

## Examples:
Let's consider some examples to demonstrate the execution of the code:

**Example 1:**
```java
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
```
**Output:**
```java
The sum of the two numbers is: 8
```

**Example 2:**
```java
Enter the first number: -2
Enter the second number: 7
```
**Output:**
```java
The sum of the two numbers is: 5
```

**Example 3:**
```java
Enter the first number: 0
Enter the second number: 0
```
**Output:**
```java
The sum of the two numbers is: 0
```

## Test Cases:
Here are some additional test cases to validate the code further:

1. Input: `firstNumber = 100`, `secondNumber = -50`
   Output: `The sum of the two numbers is: 50`

2. Input: `firstNumber = -10`, `secondNumber = -20`
   Output: `The sum of the two numbers is: -30`

3. Input: `firstNumber = 0`, `secondNumber = 1000`
   Output: `The sum of the two numbers is: 1000`

### Rationale:
The test cases cover scenarios with positive, negative, and zero values for both input numbers, ensuring the code handles different cases correctly.

## Troubleshooting:
While using the code, users might encounter some common issues or errors. Here are some potential problems and their solutions:

1. **Input Validation**: If the user enters non-integer values (e.g., characters, decimal numbers), the program will throw an `InputMismatchException`. To handle this, consider using a try-catch block around the `scanner.nextInt()` calls to handle invalid inputs gracefully.

2. **Overflow**: In case of extremely large input numbers, the sum might exceed the maximum value that an integer can hold. To address this, you can use a data type with a larger range, such as `long` or `BigInteger` in Java.
