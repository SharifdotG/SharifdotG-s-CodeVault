# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that will enter two numbers from the user and then calculate and display the sum of those two numbers.

To solve this problem, you will need to:

* **Declare two variables** to store the two numbers that the user will enter.
* **Prompt the user to enter the two numbers**.
* **Read the two numbers from the user** using the `scanf()` function.
* **Calculate the sum of the two numbers** using the `+` operator.
* **Display the sum of the two numbers** using the `printf()` function.

Here is an example of an algorithm for solving this problem:

```
1. Declare two variables, `num1` and `num2`, to store the two numbers that the user will enter.
2. Prompt the user to enter the two numbers.
3. Read the two numbers from the user using the `scanf()` function.
4. Calculate the sum of the two numbers using the `+` operator.
5. Display the sum of the two numbers using the `printf()` function.
```

Here is an example of pseudocode for solving this problem:

```
START
  DECLARE num1, num2 AS INTEGER
  INPUT num1, num2
  sum = num1 + num2
  PRINT sum
END
```

I hope this Code Hint helps you to solve the problem without seeing the code!
