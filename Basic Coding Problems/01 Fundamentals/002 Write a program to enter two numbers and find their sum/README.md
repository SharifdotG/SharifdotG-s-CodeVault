# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Description
Write a program to enter two numbers and find their sum.

### Example Input and Output
Input:
```
Number 1: 5
Number 2: 3
```
Output:
```
Sum: 8
```

### Constraints
- The input numbers are integers.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to create a program that takes two numbers as input and calculates their sum. The program should then display the result as output. It's important to remember that the input should be in integer format.

### Step 2: Plan the Approach
To solve this problem, we'll take two integer inputs from the user, and then we'll add them together to find their sum.

### Step 3: Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in a variable (let's call it `num1`).
3. Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in another variable (let's call it `num2`).
4. Add `num1` and `num2` together to get the sum.
5. Store the sum in a variable (let's call it `sum`).
6. Display the value of `sum` as the output.
7. End the program.

### Step 4: Pseudocode
```
START
    INPUT "Number 1: " as num1
    INPUT "Number 2: " as num2
    sum = num1 + num2
    OUTPUT "Sum: " + sum
END
```

### Step 5: Test Cases
Test Case 1:
```
Number 1: 10
Number 2: 20
Sum: 30
```

Test Case 2:
```
Number 1: -5
Number 2: 8
Sum: 3
```

Test Case 3:
```
Number 1: 0
Number 2: 0
Sum: 0
```

### Hints
- Remember to use the appropriate input functions to receive user input.
- Make sure to handle integer input, as the problem specifies that the numbers are integers.
- Double-check your addition logic to ensure the sum is calculated correctly.

## Final Remarks
Congratulations! You now have a detailed guide to solve the problem of finding the sum of two numbers. Before you jump into the code, take some time to understand the steps and algorithm we provided. Attempt to write the code yourself following the guide. Understanding the problem and planning the solution is crucial in becoming a better programmer. Happy coding!
