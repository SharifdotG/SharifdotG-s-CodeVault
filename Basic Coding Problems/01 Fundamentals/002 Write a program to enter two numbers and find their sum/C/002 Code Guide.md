# Here is the code guide for the C program to enter two numbers and find their sum:

## The Problem

The problem is to write a C program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then finds and prints the sum of the two numbers.

## Code Explanation

The code is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int first_number, second_number, sum;

    printf("Enter the first number: ");
    scanf("%d", &first_number);

    printf("Enter the second number: ");
    scanf("%d", &second_number);

    sum = first_number + second_number;

    printf("The sum of the two numbers is: %d\n", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

The first line, `#include <stdio.h>`, tells the compiler to include the `stdio.h` header file, which contains the definitions for the `printf()` and `scanf()` functions.

The next line, `int main() {`, marks the beginning of the `main()` function, which is the starting point of the program.

The next three lines, `int first_number, second_number, sum;`, declare three variables: `first_number`, `second_number`, and `sum`. The `first_number` and `second_number` variables will store the two numbers entered by the user, and the `sum` variable will store the sum of the two numbers.

The next three lines,

```c
printf("Enter the first number: ");
scanf("%d", &first_number);

printf("Enter the second number: ");
scanf("%d", &second_number);
```

prompt the user to enter the two numbers, and then store the user's input in the `first_number` and `second_number` variables.

The next line,

```c
sum = first_number + second_number;
```

calculates the sum of the two numbers and stores the result in the `sum` variable.

The next line,

```c
printf("The sum of the two numbers is: %d\n", sum);
```

prints the sum of the two numbers to the console.

The last line, `return 0;`, marks the end of the `main()` function and returns a value of 0 to the operating system.
