# Code Guide: Finding the Sum of Two Numbers

## Introduction:
Welcome to the code guide for the problem "Finding the Sum of Two Numbers." This repository contains solutions to various programming problems, and this particular problem is designed to help you understand how to write a C program to find the sum of two numbers. The guide will walk you through the problem description, the approach taken, and a detailed explanation of the code to help you understand the solution better.

## Problem Description:
The task at hand is to write a C program that takes two numbers as input and calculates their sum. The program should then display the result of the addition.

### Problem Statement:
Write a C program to enter two numbers and find their sum.

### Input:
- The user will be prompted to enter two numbers.

### Output:
- The program will display the sum of the two input numbers.

## Approach:
To solve this problem, we will follow a straightforward approach using basic arithmetic operations. The algorithm for finding the sum of two numbers is as follows:

1. Start the program.
2. Declare variables to store the two input numbers and the sum.
3. Prompt the user to enter the first number.
4. Read the first number from the user using the "scanf" function.
5. Prompt the user to enter the second number.
6. Read the second number from the user using the "scanf" function.
7. Add the two numbers and store the result in the "sum" variable.
8. Display the sum using the "printf" function.
9. End the program.

The data structure used here is simple variables to store the numbers and the sum.

## Code Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the code step-by-step to understand each part and how it works:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Step 1: Declare variables
    int firstNumber, secondNumber, sum;

    // Step 2: Prompt user for the first number
    printf("Enter the first number: ");
    // Step 3: Read the first number from the user
    scanf("%d", &firstNumber);

    // Step 4: Prompt user for the second number
    printf("Enter the second number: ");
    // Step 5: Read the second number from the user
    scanf("%d", &secondNumber);

    // Step 6: Calculate the sum
    sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;

    // Step 7: Display the sum
    printf("The sum of the two numbers is: %d\n", sum);

    // Step 8: End the program
    return 0;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis:
Now, let's discuss the time and space complexity of the algorithm used to find the sum of two numbers.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is constant (O(1)) because the execution time does not depend on the input size. It only involves basic arithmetic operations and input/output operations, which take a constant amount of time regardless of the input values.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is also constant (O(1)) as it uses a fixed amount of memory to store the variables (firstNumber, secondNumber, sum) regardless of the input size.

## Examples:
Let's go through a few examples to understand how the code execution works:

### Example 1:
```
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 7
The sum of the two numbers is: 12
```

In this example, the user inputs two numbers, 5 and 7. The program calculates the sum (5 + 7 = 12) and displays the result.

### Example 2:
```
Enter the first number: -2
Enter the second number: 3
The sum of the two numbers is: 1
```

In this example, the user inputs two numbers, -2 and 3. The program calculates the sum (-2 + 3 = 1) and displays the result.

## Test Cases:
Here are some test cases to validate the code further:

1. Test Case: Both numbers are positive
   - Input: 8, 12
   - Output: The sum of the two numbers is: 20

2. Test Case: One number is zero
   - Input: 25, 0
   - Output: The sum of the two numbers is: 25

3. Test Case: One number is negative
   - Input: -7, 5
   - Output: The sum of the two numbers is: -2

4. Test Case: Both numbers are negative
   - Input: -10, -15
   - Output: The sum of the two numbers is: -25

## Troubleshooting:
In case you encounter any issues while using the code, here are some common problems and their solutions:

1. **Input Validation**: Ensure that you provide valid integer inputs when prompted. Non-integer inputs can lead to unexpected behavior.

2. **Integer Overflow**: Be cautious with extremely large numbers, as the program may not handle integer overflow. The sum of two very large numbers might result in incorrect output.

3. **Compiler Errors**: If you encounter compiler errors, check for typos or syntax errors in the code. Ensure that the C compiler is properly installed and configured on your system.
