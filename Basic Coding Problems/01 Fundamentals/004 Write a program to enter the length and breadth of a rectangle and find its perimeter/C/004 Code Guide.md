# Here is the Code Guide for the problem of finding the perimeter of a rectangle:

## The Problem

The problem is to write a program that takes the length and breadth of a rectangle as input and prints the perimeter of the rectangle as output.

The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all the sides of the rectangle. It can be calculated using the following formula:

```c
rectanglePerimeter = 2 * (rectangleLength + rectangleBreadth);
```

where `rectangleLength` is the length of the rectangle and `rectangleBreadth` is the breadth of the rectangle.

## Code Explanation

The code for this problem is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int rectangleLength, rectangleBreadth, rectanglePerimeter;

    printf("Enter the length of the rectangle: ");
    scanf("%d", &rectangleLength);

    printf("Enter the breadth of the rectangle: ");
    scanf("%d", &rectangleBreadth);

    rectanglePerimeter = 2 * (rectangleLength + rectangleBreadth);

    printf("The perimeter of the rectangle is: %d\n", rectanglePerimeter);

    return 0;
}
```

The first step in the code is to declare the variables that will be used. These variables are `rectangleLength`, `rectangleBreadth`, and `perimeter`. The `rectangleLength` and `rectangleBreadth` variables will store the length and breadth of the rectangle, respectively. The `` variable will store the perimeter of the rectangle.

The next step in the code is to get the input from the user. This is done using the `printf()` and `scanf()` functions. The `printf()` function is used to print a message to the user, and the `scanf()` function is used to read input from the user.

The next step in the code is to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. This is done using the ` = 2 * (rectangleLength + rectangleBreadth)` formula.

The final step in the code is to print the perimeter of the rectangle. This is done using the `printf()` function.
