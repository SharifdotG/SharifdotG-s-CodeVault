# Here is the code guide for the rectangle perimeter program:

**Problem:**

The problem is to write a program that enters the length and breadth of a rectangle and finds its perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all four sides of the rectangle.

**Code Explanation:**

The code for the rectangle perimeter program is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class rectangle_perimeter {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the length of the rectangle: ");
        int length = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter the breadth of the rectangle: ");
        int breadth = scanner.nextInt();

        int perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth);

        System.out.println("The perimeter of the rectangle is: " + perimeter);
    }
}
```

The first line imports the `java.util.Scanner` class, which is used to read input from the user. The next line creates a new `Scanner` object and assigns it to the variable `scanner`.

The next few lines prompt the user to enter the length and breadth of the rectangle. The `nextInt()` method of the `Scanner` class is used to read an integer value from the user.

The `perimeter` variable is then initialized to 2 * (length + breadth). This is the formula for calculating the perimeter of a rectangle.

The last line prints the value of the `perimeter` variable.

**Conclusion:**

This code guide has explained the problem and the code for the rectangle perimeter program in detail. I hope this helps you understand the code. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment in the repository.

**Additional Information:**

The `Scanner` class is a very useful class for reading input from the user. It can be used to read any type of data, including integers, strings, and doubles. For more information on the `Scanner` class, please refer to the Java documentation: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html.

The `nextInt()` method of the `Scanner` class reads an integer value from the user. The `next()` method can also be used to read an integer value from the user, but it will also read any whitespace characters that come before the integer value. For example, if the user enters the value `10 20`, the `next()` method will return the value `10` and the `nextInt()` method will return the value `20`.

The `perimeter` variable is a local variable. This means that it is only accessible within the `main()` method. If you want to access the `perimeter` variable from another method, you will need to declare it as a global variable.

I hope this additional information is helpful.
