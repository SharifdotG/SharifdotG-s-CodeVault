# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that will input the length and breadth of a rectangle and then calculate its perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all its sides.

To solve this problem, you will need to:

1. Get the length and breadth of the rectangle from the user.
2. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula `perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth)`.
3. Print the perimeter of the rectangle to the console.

Here is an algorithm for solving this problem:

```
1. Get the length and breadth of the rectangle from the user.
2. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula `perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth)`.
3. Print the perimeter of the rectangle to the console.
```

Here is a pseudocode for solving this problem:

```
length = get_length()
breadth = get_breadth()
perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth)
print(perimeter)
```

I hope this Code Hint helps you solve the problem without seeing the code. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

**Additional Tips:**

* You can use any programming language to solve this problem.
* If you are stuck, try to break the problem down into smaller steps.
* Once you have a solution, try to test it with different values for the length and breadth of the rectangle.
* Good luck!
