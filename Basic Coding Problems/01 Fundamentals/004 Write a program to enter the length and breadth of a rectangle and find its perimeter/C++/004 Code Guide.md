# Here is the Code Guide for the C++ code:

**Understanding the problem**

The first step to solving any coding problem is to understand the problem. In this case, the problem is to write a C++ program to enter the length and breadth of a rectangle and find its perimeter.

To understand the problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. Prompt the user to enter the length of the rectangle.
2. Prompt the user to enter the breadth of the rectangle.
3. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.
4. Print the perimeter of the rectangle.

**Approaching the problem**

Once we understand the problem, we can start to approach it. There are many different ways to solve this problem, but one simple approach is to use the following steps:

1. Use the `std::cout` object to prompt the user to enter the length of the rectangle.
2. Use the `std::cin` object to read the user's input and store it in a variable.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the breadth of the rectangle.
4. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula `2 * (length + breadth)`.
5. Use the `std::cout` object to print the perimeter of the rectangle.

**Solving the problem**

The code below solves the problem using the approach outlined above:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    // Declare variables to store the length and breadth of the rectangle.
    int length, breadth, perimeter;

    // Prompt the user to enter the length of the rectangle.
    cout << "Enter the length of the rectangle: ";
    cin >> length;

    // Prompt the user to enter the breadth of the rectangle.
    cout << "Enter the breadth of the rectangle: ";
    cin >> breadth;

    // Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.
    perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth);

    // Print the perimeter of the rectangle.
    cout << "The perimeter of the rectangle is: " << perimeter << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
