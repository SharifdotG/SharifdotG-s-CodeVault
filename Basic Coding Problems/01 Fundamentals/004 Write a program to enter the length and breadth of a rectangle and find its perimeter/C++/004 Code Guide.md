# Here is the code guide for the C++ program to find the perimeter of a rectangle:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that allows the user to enter the length and breadth of a rectangle and then calculates and prints the perimeter of the rectangle.

**Code Explanation**

The code for this problem is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int length, breadth, perimeter;

    cout << "Enter the length of the rectangle: ";
    cin >> length;

    cout << "Enter the breadth of the rectangle: ";
    cin >> breadth;

    perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth);

    cout << "The perimeter of the rectangle is: " << perimeter << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code, `#include <iostream>`, tells the compiler to include the `iostream` header file. This header file contains the definition of the `cout` and `cin` objects, which are used to output and input data, respectively.

The next line of code, `using namespace std;`, tells the compiler to use the `std` namespace. This namespace contains all of the standard C++ library functions, including `cout` and `cin`.

The next three lines of code, `int length, breadth, perimeter;`, declare three variables of type `int`. The variables `length` and `breadth` will be used to store the length and breadth of the rectangle, respectively. The variable `perimeter` will be used to store the perimeter of the rectangle.

The next three lines of code,
```c++
cout << "Enter the length of the rectangle: ";
cin >> length;

cout << "Enter the breadth of the rectangle: ";
cin >> breadth;
```
prompt the user to enter the length and breadth of the rectangle. The `cout` object is used to output the prompt, and the `cin` object is used to input the user's response.

The next line of code,
```c++
perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth);
```
calculates the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to twice the sum of the length and breadth. The `2 *` operator multiplies the sum of the length and breadth by 2.

The next line of code,
```c++
cout << "The perimeter of the rectangle is: " << perimeter << endl;
```
outputs the perimeter of the rectangle. The `cout` object is used to output the perimeter, and the `endl` manipulator is used to insert a newline character at the end of the output.

The last line of code,
```c++
return 0;
```
indicates that the program has completed successfully.

**Conclusion**

This code guide has explained the C++ program to find the perimeter of a rectangle in detail. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment in the repository.
