# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

## Problem Name: Basic I/O

### Problem Description
In this coding challenge, you will learn how to perform basic input and output operations in programming. You will be given some input, and your task is to process it and produce the expected output. This is an essential skill for any programmer, as it forms the foundation for more complex problem-solving.

### Example Input and Output
**Example 1:**
Input:
```
5
```
Output:
```
You entered: 5
```

**Example 2:**
Input:
```
Hello, CodeVault!
```
Output:
```
You entered: Hello, CodeVault!
```

### Constraints
- The input can be a single integer or a string.
- The length of the string input will not exceed 100 characters.

### Understand the Problem
Before diving into the code, let's break down the problem:
- We need to read input from the user.
- We need to process the input in some way.
- We need to output the processed information.

### Plan the Approach
A high-level approach to solving this problem involves:
1. Reading input from the user.
2. Processing the input if necessary.
3. Displaying the processed output.

### Algorithm
1. Read input using a suitable method.
2. If the input is an integer, convert it to a string.
3. Display the input in a formatted way.

### Pseudocode
```plaintext
1. Read input from the user and store it in 'input_data'.
2. If 'input_data' is an integer, convert it to a string.
3. Print "You entered: " concatenated with 'input_data'.
```

### Test Cases
**Test Case 1:**
Input: 42
Output: "You entered: 42"

**Test Case 2:**
Input: "Greetings, everyone!"
Output: "You entered: Greetings, everyone!"

### Additional Guidance
Remember, the key is to understand the problem and develop a logical approach. Focus on each step of the process: input, processing, and output. Think about how to format the output string correctly.

### Final Remarks
Before jumping to the code, take a moment to grasp the problem and its requirements. Try to implement the solution on your own by following the provided steps. If you encounter difficulties, refer to the algorithm and pseudocode for guidance. Remember that the journey of problem-solving is as important as the solution itself.
