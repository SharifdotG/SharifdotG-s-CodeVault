# Code Guide: Rectangle Perimeter

## Introduction

Welcome to SharifdotG's CodeVault! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive learning resource for various programming concepts by presenting well-organized code samples and detailed explanations. Each problem is categorized to aid fellow learners in understanding and mastering fundamental programming challenges.

## Problem Description

This Code Guide focuses on solving the "Rectangle Perimeter" problem. Given the length and breadth of a rectangle, the goal is to calculate and display its perimeter. The program takes user input for the rectangle's dimensions and outputs the calculated perimeter.

**Input:**  
- Length of the rectangle
- Breadth of the rectangle

**Output:**  
- Perimeter of the rectangle

## About the Problem

The concept of calculating the perimeter of a rectangle is widely used in geometry and real-world applications. It's fundamental to fields like architecture, engineering, and computer graphics.

## Approach

To solve the problem of finding the perimeter of a rectangle, I utilized a straightforward mathematical formula: `perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth)`. This formula stems from the fact that a rectangle has four sides of equal lengths in pairs. I implemented this algorithm in the C programming language to demonstrate the process step by step.

## Code Walkthrough

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int rectangleLength, rectangleBreadth, rectanglePerimeter;

    // Input the length of the rectangle
    printf("Enter the length of the rectangle: ");
    scanf("%d", &rectangleLength);

    // Input the breadth of the rectangle
    printf("Enter the breadth of the rectangle: ");
    scanf("%d", &rectangleBreadth);

    // Calculate the perimeter using the formula
    rectanglePerimeter = 2 * (rectangleLength + rectangleBreadth);

    // Display the calculated perimeter
    printf("The perimeter of the rectangle is: %d\n", rectanglePerimeter);

    return 0;
}
```

1. **Input:** Prompt the user to enter the length and breadth of the rectangle using `printf` and capture their input using `scanf`.

2. **Calculation:** Calculate the rectangle's perimeter using the provided formula `2 * (length + breadth)` and store it in the `rectanglePerimeter` variable.

3. **Output:** Display the calculated perimeter to the user using `printf`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm involves simple arithmetic operations and input/output operations, resulting in constant time complexity, O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** The algorithm utilizes a few integer variables, so the space complexity is also O(1).

## Examples

Let's go through a couple of examples to illustrate the program's execution:

**Example 1:**
- Input: Length = 5, Breadth = 3
- Output: The perimeter of the rectangle is: 16

**Example 2:**
- Input: Length = 8, Breadth = 6
- Output: The perimeter of the rectangle is: 28

## Test Cases

1. Length = 0, Breadth = 0
   - Output: The perimeter of the rectangle is: 0

2. Length = 10, Breadth = 15
   - Output: The perimeter of the rectangle is: 50

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the code, ensure that you've entered valid numerical inputs for the rectangle's dimensions. Make sure there are no typos or syntax errors in the code.
