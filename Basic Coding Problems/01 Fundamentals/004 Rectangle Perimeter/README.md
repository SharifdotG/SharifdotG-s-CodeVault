## Problem Name: Rectangle Perimeter

### Problem Description
In this coding challenge, we'll work with rectangles and their perimeters. Given the dimensions of a rectangle as input, your task is to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The input will consist of the rectangle's length and width, and the expected output is the perimeter of the rectangle.

### Example Input and Output
**Example 1:**
Input: Length = 5, Width = 3
Output: Perimeter = 16

**Example 2:**
Input: Length = 10, Width = 7
Output: Perimeter = 34

### Constraints
- The length and width are positive integers.
- 1 <= Length, Width <= 10^9

### Understand the Problem
Before we dive into the code, let's break down the problem. We have to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, which is given by the formula: `2 * (length + width)`. To solve this problem, we need to extract the length and width from the input and apply this formula.

### Plan the Approach
1. Read the length and width from the input.
2. Calculate the perimeter using the formula: `2 * (length + width)`.

### Algorithm
1. Read the `length` and `width` from the input.
2. Calculate `perimeter` as `2 * (length + width)`.

### Pseudocode
```
Read length from input
Read width from input
Calculate perimeter as 2 * (length + width)
Print perimeter
```

### Test Cases
**Test Case 1:**
Input: Length = 4, Width = 9
Expected Output: Perimeter = 26

**Test Case 2:**
Input: Length = 15, Width = 2
Expected Output: Perimeter = 34

**Test Case 3:**
Input: Length = 1, Width = 1
Expected Output: Perimeter = 4

### Additional Guidance
Remember, the key to solving this problem is understanding the formula for calculating the perimeter of a rectangle. Try to think about how the length and width contribute to the total perimeter.

### Final Remarks
I encourage you to attempt solving the "Rectangle Perimeter" problem on your own before referring to the code. Understanding the problem-solving process is essential for becoming a better coder.
