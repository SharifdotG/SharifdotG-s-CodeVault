# Code Guide: Rectangle Perimeter

## Introduction:
Welcome to the Code Guide for the problem "Rectangle Perimeter" from SharifdotG's CodeVault repository. In this guide, I will provide a detailed walkthrough of the code solution for calculating the perimeter of a rectangle. The CodeVault repository aims to help fellow learners by categorizing and explaining various coding problems and concepts.

## Problem Description:
The "Rectangle Perimeter" problem requires calculating the perimeter of a rectangle given its length and breadth. The input consists of two integers representing the length and breadth of the rectangle. The output is the calculated perimeter of the rectangle.

## About the Problem:
Rectangles are common geometric shapes found in various real-life scenarios, such as building construction, graphic design, and more. The problem of calculating the perimeter of a rectangle has practical applications in determining the amount of material needed for framing, fencing, and other purposes.

## Approach:
To solve the "Rectangle Perimeter" problem, I followed these steps:

1. **Input:** I read the values of `rectangleLength` and `rectangleBreadth` from the user using the `cin` function.

2. **Calculation:** I calculated the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula: `rectanglePerimeter = 2 * (rectangleLength + rectangleBreadth)`.

3. **Output:** I displayed the calculated perimeter using the `cout` function.

## Code Walkthrough:
Now, let's dive into the code step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int rectangleLength, rectangleBreadth, rectanglePerimeter;

    cout << "Enter the length of the rectangle: ";
    cin >> rectangleLength;

    cout << "Enter the breadth of the rectangle: ";
    cin >> rectangleBreadth;

    rectanglePerimeter = 2 * (rectangleLength + rectangleBreadth);

    cout << "The perimeter of the rectangle is: " << rectanglePerimeter << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

1. I included the necessary header file `iostream` to enable input and output operations.

2. I declared three integer variables: `rectangleLength` to store the length of the rectangle, `rectangleBreadth` for its breadth, and `rectanglePerimeter` to hold the calculated perimeter.

3. I prompted the user to input the rectangle's length and breadth using the `cout` and `cin` functions.

4. I calculated the perimeter using the given formula and stored it in the `rectanglePerimeter` variable.

5. Finally, I displayed the result using the `cout` function.

## Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of this solution is constant, O(1), as the number of operations is fixed regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also constant, as only a few variables are used.

## Examples:
Let's consider a couple of examples:

1. **Input:** Length = 5, Breadth = 3
   **Output:** Perimeter = 16
   **Explanation:** 2 * (5 + 3) = 16

2. **Input:** Length = 10, Breadth = 7
   **Output:** Perimeter = 34
   **Explanation:** 2 * (10 + 7) = 34

## Test Cases:
Here are a few test cases to validate the code:

1. Length = 0, Breadth = 0 → Perimeter = 0
2. Length = 1, Breadth = 1 → Perimeter = 4
3. Length = 10, Breadth = 0 → Perimeter = 20

## Troubleshooting:
If you encounter issues with the code, ensure that you've correctly entered the length and breadth values. Check for any typos or syntax errors.
