# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that will enter marks of five subjects and calculate the total, average, and percentage. The program should first prompt the user to enter the marks for each subject. Once the marks have been entered, the program should calculate the total mark by adding the marks of all five subjects. The average mark should then be calculated by dividing the total mark by 5. Finally, the percentage should be calculated by multiplying the average mark by 100.

Here are some tips and tricks for solving this problem:

* Use variables to store the marks for each subject.
* Use a loop to iterate through the marks and add them up.
* Use the `round()` function to round the average mark to two decimal places.
* Use the `print()` function to print the total, average, and percentage.

Here is an algorithm for solving this problem:

1. Prompt the user to enter the marks for each subject.
2. Store the marks in variables.
3. Calculate the total mark by adding the marks of all five subjects.
4. Calculate the average mark by dividing the total mark by 5.
5. Calculate the percentage by multiplying the average mark by 100.
6. Print the total, average, and percentage.

Here is a pseudocode for solving this problem:

```
start
  prompt user to enter marks for each subject
  store marks in variables
  calculate total mark by adding marks of all five subjects
  calculate average mark by dividing total mark by 5
  calculate percentage by multiplying average mark by 100
  print total, average, and percentage
end
```

I hope this Code Hint helps you solve the problem!
