# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

**Problem:**

Write a program to enter Principal, Time and Rate of Interest and calculate Simple Interest.

**General Information:**

* Simple Interest is a type of interest that is calculated on the principal amount for a certain period of time at a fixed rate of interest.
* The formula for calculating Simple Interest is:

```
Simple Interest = (Principal * Time * Rate of Interest) / 100
```

* Where:
    * Principal is the amount of money borrowed or invested.
    * Time is the number of years for which the money is borrowed or invested.
    * Rate of Interest is the percentage of interest that is charged or paid on the principal amount.

**Tips and Tricks:**

* Make sure that you understand the formula for calculating Simple Interest before you start writing your program.
* Use variables to store the values of the principal amount, time and rate of interest.
* Calculate the Simple Interest using the formula and print the result.

**Algorithm:**

```
1. Get the principal amount, time and rate of interest from the user.
2. Calculate the Simple Interest using the formula.
3. Print the Simple Interest.
```

**Pseudocode:**

```
Start

Get the principal amount, time and rate of interest from the user.
Calculate the Simple Interest using the formula.
Print the Simple Interest.

End
```
