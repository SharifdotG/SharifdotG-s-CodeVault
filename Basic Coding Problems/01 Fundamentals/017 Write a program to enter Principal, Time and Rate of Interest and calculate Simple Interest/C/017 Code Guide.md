# Here is the Code Guide for the problem of calculating simple interest in C:

**Problem:**

The problem is to write a program that takes the principal amount, time period, and interest rate as input and calculates the simple interest.

**Code Explanation:**

The code is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float principal, time, rate_of_interest, simple_interest;

    printf("Enter the principal amount: ");
    scanf("%f", &principal);

    printf("Enter the time period in years: ");
    scanf("%f", &time);

    printf("Enter the interest rate: ");
    scanf("%f", &rate_of_interest);

    simple_interest = principal * time * rate_of_interest / 100;

    printf("The simple interest is: %f\n", simple_interest);

    return 0;
}
```

The code first declares four variables: `principal`, `time`, `rate_of_interest`, and `simple_interest`. The `principal` variable stores the principal amount, the `time` variable stores the time period, the `rate_of_interest` variable stores the interest rate, and the `simple_interest` variable stores the calculated simple interest.

The next few lines of code prompt the user to enter the principal amount, time period, and interest rate. The `scanf()` function is used to read the user input and store it in the corresponding variables.

The next line of code calculates the simple interest using the following formula:

```
simple_interest = principal * time * rate_of_interest / 100
```

The final line of code prints the simple interest to the console.

**Conclusion:**

This code can be used to calculate simple interest. The code is well-commented and easy to understand. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment on the repository.
