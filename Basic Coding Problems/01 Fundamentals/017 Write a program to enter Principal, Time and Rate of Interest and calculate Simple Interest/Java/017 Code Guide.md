# Here is the code guide for the simple interest program:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that calculates the simple interest given the principal amount, time, and interest rate.

**Code Explanation**

The code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class simple_interest {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Get the principal amount, time, and interest rate from the user.
        System.out.print("Enter the principal amount: ");
        float principal = input.nextFloat();

        System.out.print("Enter the time period in years: ");
        float time = input.nextFloat();

        System.out.print("Enter the interest rate: ");
        float rateOfInterest = input.nextFloat();

        // Calculate the simple interest.
        float simpleInterest = principal * time * rateOfInterest / 100;

        // Print the simple interest.
        System.out.println("The simple interest is: " + simpleInterest);
    }
}
```

The first line imports the `java.util.Scanner` class, which is used to get input from the user.

The next line declares a `Scanner` object named `input`.

The following lines get the principal amount, time, and interest rate from the user using the `input` object.

The `simpleInterest` variable is then initialized to the product of the principal amount, time, and interest rate, divided by 100.

The `simpleInterest` variable is then printed to the console.

**Conclusion**

This code guide has explained the problem and the code in detail. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment on the repository.

Here are some additional notes about the code:

* The `Scanner` class is a very powerful tool for getting input from the user. It can be used to get input of any type, including numbers, strings, and dates.
* The `System.out.println()` method is used to print output to the console.
* The `*`, `/`, and `%` operators are used to perform multiplication, division, and modulus operations, respectively.

I hope this code guide is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
