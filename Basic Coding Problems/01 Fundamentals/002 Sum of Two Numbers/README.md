## Problem Name: Sum of Two Numbers

### Problem Description:
In the "Sum of Two Numbers" problem, you are tasked with writing a program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. The input consists of two integers, and the expected output is the sum of these two numbers.

### Example Input and Output:
Example 1:
Input: `5 3`
Output: `8`

Example 2:
Input: `-2 7`
Output: `5`

### Constraints:
- The input numbers are integers.
- The integers can be both positive and negative.
- The integers can be within the range of -10^9 to 10^9.

### Understand the Problem:
Before diving into the code, let's break down the problem. We need to take two numbers as input and then compute their sum. It might be tempting to immediately jump to writing code, but taking a moment to understand the problem and plan a strategy will make the coding process smoother.

### Plan the Approach:
To solve this problem, we can use a straightforward approach:
1. Read two integers from the user.
2. Add the two integers together to compute the sum.
3. Print the sum as the output.

### Algorithm:
1. Read the first integer, let's call it `num1`.
2. Read the second integer, let's call it `num2`.
3. Calculate the sum: `sum = num1 + num2`.
4. Print the value of `sum` as the output.

### Pseudocode:
```plaintext
Read num1
Read num2
sum = num1 + num2
Print sum
```

### Test Cases:
Test Case 1:
Input: `10 20`
Expected Output: `30`

Test Case 2:
Input: `-5 12`
Expected Output: `7`

Test Case 3:
Input: `0 0`
Expected Output: `0`

### Additional Guidance:
Remember that the key to solving any problem is understanding the underlying logic. Try to identify patterns or relationships between the input and output. If you encounter difficulties, break the problem down into smaller steps.
