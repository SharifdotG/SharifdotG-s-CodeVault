# Code Guide: Sum of Two Numbers

## Introduction
Welcome to SharifdotG's CodeVault! This repository is dedicated to helping fellow learners understand various programming concepts through hands-on code examples. In this Code Guide, we will dive into the problem of adding two numbers and provide a comprehensive walkthrough of the solution.

## Problem Description
The "Sum of Two Numbers" problem involves taking two integers as input and calculating their sum. The problem statement is as follows:
Given two integers, your task is to find their sum.

**Input:**
- Two integers, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`.

**Output:**
- The sum of the two input numbers.

## About the Problem
The concept of adding two numbers is fundamental in mathematics and computer programming. It finds applications in various real-life scenarios such as calculating expenses, scores, or quantities.

## Approach
To solve the "Sum of Two Numbers" problem, I followed a simple approach that involves reading two integers from the user, adding them together, and then displaying the result.

**Algorithm:**
1. Read the first number (`firstNumber`) from the user.
2. Read the second number (`secondNumber`) from the user.
3. Calculate the sum: `sum = firstNumber + secondNumber`.
4. Display the result: `The sum of the two numbers is: sum`.

## Code Walkthrough
Let's break down the code into logical sections and explain each step in detail:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SumOfTwoNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int firstNumber, secondNumber, sum;

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;

        System.out.println("The sum of the two numbers is: " + sum);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

1. Import the `Scanner` class to read input from the user.
2. Declare three integer variables: `firstNumber`, `secondNumber`, and `sum`.
3. Create a `Scanner` object named `scanner` to read user input.
4. Prompt the user to enter the first number.
5. Read and store the first number in the variable `firstNumber`.
6. Prompt the user to enter the second number.
7. Read and store the second number in the variable `secondNumber`.
8. Calculate the sum of the two numbers and store it in the variable `sum`.
9. Display the result, showing the sum of the two numbers.
10. Close the `Scanner` to release resources.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this algorithm is constant, O(1), as it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input.

The space complexity is also constant, O(1), as it uses a fixed amount of memory to store the input numbers and the sum.

## Examples
Let's work through some examples to understand how the code works:

**Example 1:**
```
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 7
The sum of the two numbers is: 12
```

**Example 2:**
```
Enter the first number: -3
Enter the second number: 10
The sum of the two numbers is: 7
```

## Test Cases
Here are a few test cases to validate the code:

1. Input: `firstNumber = 0`, `secondNumber = 0`
   Output: `The sum of the two numbers is: 0`

2. Input: `firstNumber = -5`, `secondNumber = 5`
   Output: `The sum of the two numbers is: 0`

3. Input: `firstNumber = 15`, `secondNumber = 20`
   Output: `The sum of the two numbers is: 35`

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using the code, consider the following solutions:

- Ensure that you are providing valid integer inputs.
- Check for any syntax errors or typos in the code.
- Make sure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
