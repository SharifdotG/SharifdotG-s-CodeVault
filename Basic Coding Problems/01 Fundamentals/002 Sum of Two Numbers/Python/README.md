# Code Guide: Sum of Two Numbers

## Introduction
Welcome to my CodeVault! This repository is dedicated to helping fellow learners understand coding concepts through practical examples. In this guide, we will delve into the "Sum of Two Numbers" problem, providing a detailed walkthrough of the solution code and explaining the underlying principles.

## Problem Description
The "Sum of Two Numbers" problem involves taking two integer inputs and calculating their sum. The program should prompt the user to enter the two numbers and then display the sum of the numbers as output.

**Input:**
- Two integer numbers

**Output:**
- The sum of the two numbers

## About the Problem
The concept of adding two numbers is fundamental in mathematics and programming. It forms the basis for various computational tasks and real-life scenarios, such as calculating expenses, scores, or quantities.

## Approach
To solve the "Sum of Two Numbers" problem, I adopted a simple approach that directly adds the two input numbers together. This approach does not require any complex algorithms or data structures.

## Code Walkthrough
```python
# Prompt the user to enter the first number
firstNumber = int(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Prompt the user to enter the second number
secondNumber = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers
sum = firstNumber + secondNumber

# Display the result
print("The sum of the two numbers is:", sum)
```

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this solution is constant time O(1), as the number of input values does not affect the execution time significantly. The space complexity is also O(1), as we only use a constant amount of memory to store variables.

## Examples
Let's walk through a couple of examples to illustrate the code execution:

**Example 1:**
```
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 7
The sum of the two numbers is: 12
```

**Example 2:**
```
Enter the first number: -3
Enter the second number: 9
The sum of the two numbers is: 6
```

## Test Cases
Here are some additional test cases to verify the code's correctness:

1. Input: 0, 0
   Output: The sum of the two numbers is: 0

2. Input: -10, 10
   Output: The sum of the two numbers is: 0

3. Input: 100, -50
   Output: The sum of the two numbers is: 50

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using this code, ensure that you are providing valid integer inputs. If the program crashes or produces unexpected results, double-check the input values and verify that you are using the correct syntax.
