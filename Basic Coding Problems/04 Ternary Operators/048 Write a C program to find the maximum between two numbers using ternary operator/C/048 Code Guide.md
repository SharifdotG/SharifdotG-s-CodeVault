# Here is a detailed guideline for the problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem is to write a C program to find the maximum between two numbers using the ternary operator. The ternary operator is a conditional operator that can be used to evaluate a condition and return the appropriate value. In this case, the condition is whether the first number is greater than the second number. If the first number is greater, then the ternary operator will return the value of the first number. Otherwise, the ternary operator will return the value of the second number.

**Approaching the Problem**

The first step in approaching this problem is to declare two variables to store the first and second numbers. Then, the user is prompted to enter the values of the two numbers. Next, the ternary operator is used to calculate the maximum number and store it in a third variable. Finally, the maximum number is printed to the console.

**Solving the Problem**

The code below solves the problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int first_number;
  int second_number;
  int max;

  printf("Enter the value of the first number: ");
  scanf("%d", &first_number);

  printf("Enter the value of of the second number: ");
  scanf("%d", &second_number);

  max = (first_number > second_number) ? first_number : second_number;

  printf("The maximum value is: %d\n", max);

  return 0;
}
```

This code first declares three variables to store the first, second, and maximum numbers. Then, the user is prompted to enter the values of the first and second numbers. Next, the ternary operator is used to calculate the maximum number and store it in the `max` variable. Finally, the maximum number is printed to the console.

**How the Code Works**

The ternary operator in the code works as follows:

```c
max = (first_number > second_number) ? first_number : second_number;
```

The ternary operator takes `three operands`: a `condition`, a `true value`, and a `false value`. If the condition is true, then the true value is returned. Otherwise, the false value is returned.

In this case, the condition is whether the first number is greater than the second number. If the first number is greater, then the true value, which is the first number, is returned. Otherwise, the false value, which is the second number, is returned.
