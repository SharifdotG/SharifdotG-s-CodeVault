**Understanding the Problem**

The problem is to write a C program to find the roots of a quadratic equation using switch case. A quadratic equation is an equation of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are real numbers. The roots of a quadratic equation are the values of x that satisfy the equation.

**Approaching the Problem**

The following steps can be used to approach the problem:

1. Read the problem carefully and understand the requirements.
2. Identify the key components of the problem, such as the coefficients of the quadratic equation, the discriminant, and the roots.
3. Develop an algorithm to solve the problem.
4. Implement the algorithm in C code.
5. Test the code and debug any errors.

**Solving the Problem**

The following code can be used to solve the problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {

  float coefficient_a, coefficient_b, coefficient_c;
  float discriminant;
  float root_1, root_2;
  float real_part, imaginary_part;

  printf("Enter the values of coefficient a, b, and c: ");
  scanf("%f %f %f", &coefficient_a, &coefficient_b, &coefficient_c);

  discriminant = coefficient_b * coefficient_b - 4 * coefficient_a * coefficient_c;

  switch (discriminant > 0) {

    case 1:
      root_1 = (-coefficient_b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * coefficient_a);
      root_2 = (-coefficient_b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * coefficient_a);
      printf("The roots are %.2f and %.2f\n", root_1, root_2);
      break;

    case 0:
      root_1 = root_2 = -coefficient_b / (2 * coefficient_a);
      printf("The roots are %.2f and %.2f\n", root_1, root_2);
      break;

    default:
      real_part = -coefficient_b / (2 * coefficient_a);
      imaginary_part = sqrt(-discriminant) / (2 * coefficient_a);
      printf("The roots are %.2f + %.2fi and %.2f - %.2fi\n", real_part, imaginary_part, real_part, imaginary_part);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This code first reads the values of the coefficients of the quadratic equation from the user. Then, it calculates the discriminant of the quadratic equation. The discriminant is a measure of how far the roots of the quadratic equation are from the origin. If the discriminant is positive, then the roots are real and distinct. If the discriminant is equal to 0, then the roots are real and equal. If the discriminant is negative, then the roots are complex and distinct.

The code then uses a switch statement to determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation. The switch statement has three cases:

* Case 1: The discriminant is positive. In this case, the roots are real and distinct. The code calculates the roots of the quadratic equation and prints them to the console.
* Case 2: The discriminant is equal to 0. In this case, the roots are real and equal. The code calculates the roots of the quadratic equation and prints them to the console.
* Case 3: The discriminant is negative. In this case, the roots are complex and distinct. The code calculates the real and imaginary parts of the roots of the quadratic equation and prints them to the console.
