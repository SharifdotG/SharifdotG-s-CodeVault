# Here is the guideline for the coding problem:

**Problem Statement**

Write a C program to find the maximum between two numbers using switch case.

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem asks us to write a C program that takes two numbers as input and prints the maximum number. We can solve this problem using a switch case statement. The switch case statement allows us to execute different blocks of code depending on the value of a variable. In this case, we will use the switch case statement to determine the maximum number by comparing the two numbers.

**Approaching the Problem**

We can approach this problem by following these steps:

1. Declare two variables to store the two numbers.
2. Prompt the user to enter the two numbers.
3. Use a switch case statement to compare the two numbers.
4. Print the maximum number to the console.

**Solving the Problem**

The following code solves the problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int first_number;
  int second_number;

  printf("Enter two numbers: ");
  scanf("%d %d", &first_number, &second_number);

  switch (first_number > second_number) {

    case 1:
      printf("The maximum number is %d.\n", first_number);
      break;
    case 0:
      printf("The maximum number is %d.\n", second_number);
      break;
    default:
      printf("The numbers are equal.\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This code first declares two variables to store the two numbers. Then, it prompts the user to enter the two numbers. Next, it uses a switch case statement to compare the two numbers. If the first number is greater than the second number, the maximum number is the first number. If it is not, the maximum number is the second number. If the two numbers are equal, the default case is executed. Finally, the code prints the maximum number to the console.

**Explaining the Code**

The code is self-explanatory, but here is a brief explanation of each line:

```c
int first_number;
int second_number;
```

These two lines declare two variables to store the two numbers.

```c
printf("Enter two numbers: ");
scanf("%d %d", &first_number, &second_number);
```

These two lines prompt the user to enter the two numbers and store them in the `first_number` and `second_number` variables.

```c
switch (first_number > second_number) {

  case 1:
    printf("The maximum number is %d.\n", first_number);
    break;
  case 0:
    printf("The maximum number is %d.\n", second_number);
    break;
  default:
    printf("The numbers are equal.\n");
}
```

This line uses a switch case statement to compare the two numbers. If the first number is greater than the second number, the maximum number is the first number. If it is not, the maximum number is the second number. If the two numbers are equal, the default case is executed.

**Conclusion**

This is a simple C program that finds the maximum between two numbers using switch case. I hope this guideline is helpful. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment in the repository.
