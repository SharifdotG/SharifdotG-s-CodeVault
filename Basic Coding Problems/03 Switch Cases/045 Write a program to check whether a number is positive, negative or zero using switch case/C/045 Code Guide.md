# Here is the detailed guideline for the coding problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem is to write a C program to check whether a number is positive, negative or zero using switch case. The program should first prompt the user to enter a number. Then, it should use a switch statement to check whether the number is positive, negative or zero. If the number is positive, the program should print "The number is positive." If the number is negative, the program should print "The number is negative." If the number is zero, the program should print "The number is zero."

**Approaching the Problem**

The first step is to declare a variable to store the number entered by the user. Then, we need to prompt the user to enter a number. After that, we can use a switch statement to check whether the number is positive, negative or zero. The switch statement will have three cases:

* Case 1: The number is positive.
* Case 2: The number is negative.
* Case 3: The number is zero.

Each case will print a different message. For example, in case 1, the program will print "The number is positive."

**Solving the Problem**

The code below solves the problem:

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {

    int num;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    switch(num>0) {

        case 1:
            printf("The number is positive.");
            break;

        case 0:
            switch(num<0) {

                case 1:
                    printf("The number is negative.");
                    break;

                case 0:
                    printf("The number is zero.");
                    break;
            }
            break;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code includes the `stdio.h` header file, which contains the `printf()` and `scanf()` functions. The next line of code declares a variable called `num` to store the number entered by the user. The third line of code prompts the user to enter a number. The fourth line of code uses the `scanf()` function to read the number entered by the user and store it in the `num` variable.

The next part of the code is the switch statement. The switch statement checks whether the number is positive, negative or zero. The first case checks if the number is positive. If the number is positive, the `printf()` function prints "The number is positive." The second case checks if the number is negative. If the number is negative, the `printf()` function prints "The number is negative." The third case checks if the number is zero. If the number is zero, the `printf()` function prints "The number is zero."

The last line of code returns 0 to indicate success.

**Explaining the Code**

The code above is a simple C program that checks whether a number is positive, negative or zero using switch case. The code first prompts the user to enter a number. Then, it uses a switch statement to check whether the number is positive, negative or zero. If the number is positive, the program prints "The number is positive." If the number is negative, the program prints "The number is negative." If the number is zero, the program prints "The number is zero."

The switch statement is a powerful control flow statement that can be used to check for different conditions. In this case, the switch statement checks for three different conditions:

* The number is positive.
* The number is negative.
* The number is zero.

Each condition has a corresponding case. If the condition is met, the code in the case will be executed. If the condition is not met, the next case will be checked.

**Conclusion**

The code above is well-commented, so it should be easy to understand. If you have any questions about the code, you can leave a comment in the repository.

I hope this helps!
