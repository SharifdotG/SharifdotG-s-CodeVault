# Here is a detailed guideline for the coding problem you have provided:

## Understanding the problem

The first step to solving any coding problem is to understand the problem. In this case, the problem is to write a C program that will input a month number and print the number of days in that month.

To understand the problem, we need to know how many days are in each month. The following table shows the number of days in each month:

Month | Number of days
------- | --------
January | 31
February | 28 or 29
March | 31
April | 30
May | 31
June | 30
July | 31
August | 31
September | 30
October | 31
November | 30
December | 31

## Approaching the problem

Once we understand the problem, we need to come up with a plan for solving it. In this case, the plan is to:

1. Prompt the user to enter the month number.
2. Check if the month number is valid.
3. Print the number of days in the month.

## Solving the problem

The following code solves the problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int month;

  printf("Enter the month number: ");
  scanf("%d", &month);

  if (month == 1 || month == 3 || month == 5 || month == 7 || month == 8 || month == 10 || month == 12) {
    printf("The number of days in this month is 31.\n");
  } else if (month == 4 || month == 6 || month == 9 || month == 11) {
    printf("The number of days in this month is 30.\n");
  } else if (month == 2) {
    printf("The number of days in this month is 28 or 29.\n");
  } else {
    printf("Invalid month number.\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This code first prompts the user to enter the month number. Then, it checks if the month number is valid. If it is, the code prints the number of days in the month. If the month number is invalid, the code prints a message indicating that the month number is invalid.

## Submitting the code

Once you have solved the problem, you can submit your code to the repository. To do this, you will need to create a new file in the repository and add your code to the file. Then, you will need to commit your changes and push them to the repository.

## Asking for help

If you get stuck while solving the problem, you can ask for help in the repository's discussion forum. There are many other people who are working on the same problems, and they may be able to help you.
