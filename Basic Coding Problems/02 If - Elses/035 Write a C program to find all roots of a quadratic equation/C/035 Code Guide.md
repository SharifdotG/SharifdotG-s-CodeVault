# Here is a detailed guideline for the problem:

**Understanding the problem**

The problem asks you to write a C program to find all roots of a quadratic equation. A quadratic equation is an equation of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are real numbers. The roots of a quadratic equation are the values of `x` that satisfy the equation.

**Approaching the problem**

The first step to solving this problem is to calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation. The discriminant is a value that tells you the nature of the roots of the equation. If the discriminant is positive, then the equation has two real roots. If the discriminant is zero, then the equation has one repeated real root. If the discriminant is negative, then the equation has two complex roots.

Once you have calculated the discriminant, you can then use the quadratic formula to calculate the roots of the equation. The quadratic formula is:

```c
root = (-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
```

where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.

**Solving the problem**

The code below solves the problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {

    float coefficientA, coefficientB, coefficientC;
    float discriminant;
    float root1, root2;
    float realPart, imaginaryPart;

    printf("Enter the value of coefficientA, coefficientB, coefficientC: ");
    scanf("%f %f %f", &coefficientA, &coefficientB, &coefficientC);

    discriminant = coefficientB * coefficientB - 4 * coefficientA * coefficientC;

    if (discriminant > 0) {
        root1 = (-coefficientB + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * coefficientA);
        root2 = (-coefficientB - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * coefficientA);
        printf("The roots are: %.2f and %.2f\n", root1, root2);
    } else if (discriminant == 0) {
        root1 = root2 = -coefficientB / (2 * coefficientA);
        printf("The roots are: %.2f and %.2f\n", root1, root2);
    } else {
        realPart = -coefficientB / (2 * coefficientA);
        imaginaryPart = sqrt(-discriminant) / (2 * coefficientA);
        printf("The roots are: %.2f + %.2fi and %.2f - %.2fi\n", realPart, imaginaryPart, realPart, imaginaryPart);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code first prompts the user to enter the values of the coefficients of the quadratic equation. Then, it calculates the discriminant of the equation. If the discriminant is positive, then the code calculates the two real roots of the equation using the quadratic formula. If the discriminant is zero, then the code calculates the one repeated real root of the equation. If the discriminant is negative, then the code calculates the two complex roots of the equation. Finally, the code prints the roots of the equation.

**Explaining how the code works**

The code works by first calculating the discriminant of the quadratic equation. The discriminant is a value that tells you the nature of the roots of the equation. If the discriminant is positive, then the equation has two real roots. If the discriminant is zero, then the equation has one repeated real root. If the discriminant is negative, then the equation has two complex roots.

Once the discriminant has been calculated, the code then uses the quadratic formula to calculate the roots of the equation. The quadratic formula is a formula that can be used to calculate the roots of any quadratic equation.

The code then prints the roots of the equation. If the equation has two real roots, then the code prints the two roots as two separate numbers. If the equation has one repeated real root, then the code prints the root once. If the equation has two complex roots, then the code prints the two roots as two complex numbers.
