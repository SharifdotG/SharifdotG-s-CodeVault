# Here is the detailed guideline for the problem:

## Understanding the Problem

The problem is to write a C program to find the maximum between two numbers. This means that the program should take two numbers as input from the user and print the larger of the two numbers.

## Approaching the Problem

There are a few different ways to approach this problem. One way is to use the `if` statement to compare the two numbers. If the first number is larger, then the program would print that number. Otherwise, the program would print the second number.

Another way to approach this problem is to use the `max()` function. The `max()` function takes two numbers as input and returns the larger of the two numbers. The program could then use the `max()` function to print the maximum number.

## Solving the Problem

The code below solves the problem using the `if` statement:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    int first_number;
    int second_number;

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &first_number, &second_number);

    if (first_number > second_number) {
        printf("%d is greater than %d\n", first_number, second_number);
    } else {
        printf("%d is greater than %d\n", second_number, first_number);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code first declares two variables, `first_number` and `second_number`, to store the two numbers entered by the user. The code then prompts the user to enter two numbers and reads the numbers entered by the user.

The code then uses the `if` statement to compare the two numbers. If the first number is larger, then the code prints the first number. Otherwise, the code prints the second number.

## Testing the Code

To test the code, you can run it with different sets of numbers. For example, you could run the code with the numbers 10 and 5. The code should print `10 is greater than 5`.
