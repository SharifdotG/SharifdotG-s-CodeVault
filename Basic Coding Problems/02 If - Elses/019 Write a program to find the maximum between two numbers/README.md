Sure, here is the Code Hint for the problem "Write a program to find the maximum between two numbers":


CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that finds the maximum between two numbers. The maximum number is the larger of the two numbers. For example, the maximum number between 10 and 5 is 10.

To solve this problem, you will need to:

1. Read two numbers from the user.
2. Compare the two numbers.
3. Print the maximum number.

Here is an algorithm for solving this problem:

1. Read two numbers from the user.
2. Compare the two numbers using the greater than operator (>).
3. If the first number is greater than the second number, then the maximum number is the first number. Otherwise, the maximum number is the second number.
4. Print the maximum number.

Here is a pseudocode for solving this problem:

```
procedure find_maximum(num1, num2)
  if num1 > num2 then
    max = num1
  else
    max = num2
  end if
  print max
end procedure
```

I hope this helps!
