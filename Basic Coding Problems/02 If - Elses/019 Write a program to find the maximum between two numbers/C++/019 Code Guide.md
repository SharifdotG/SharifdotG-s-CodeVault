# Here is the Code Guide for the program to find the maximum between two numbers:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints the maximum number.

**Code Explanation**

The code is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int first_number, second_number, max_number;

    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> first_number >> second_number;

    if (first_number > second_number) {
        max_number = first_number;
    } else {
        max_number = second_number;
    }

    cout << max_number << " is the maximum number.\n";

    return 0;
}
```

The first step is to declare three variables: `first_number`, `second_number`, and `max_number`. The `first_number` and `second_number` variables will store the two numbers entered by the user, and the `max_number` variable will store the maximum number.

The next step is to prompt the user to enter two numbers. This is done using the `cout` statement.

```c++
cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
```

The user will then enter two numbers, which will be stored in the `first_number` and `second_number` variables.

The next step is to find the maximum number. This is done using the `if` statement.

```c++
if (first_number > second_number) {
    max_number = first_number;
} else {
    max_number = second_number;
}
```

The `if` statement first checks if `first_number` is greater than `second_number`. If it is, then `max_number` is assigned the value of `first_number`. Otherwise, `max_number` is assigned the value of `second_number`.

The final step is to print the maximum number. This is done using the `cout` statement.

```c++
cout << max_number << " is the maximum number.\n";
```

The `cout` statement will print the value of `max_number`, followed by the text " is the maximum number."

**Conclusion**

This code will find the maximum between two numbers. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment on the repository.
