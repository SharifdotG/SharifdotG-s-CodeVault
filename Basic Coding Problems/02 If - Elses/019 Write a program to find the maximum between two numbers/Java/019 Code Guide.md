# Here is the Code Guide for the problem "Write a program to find the maximum between two numbers".

### The Problem

The problem is to write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints the maximum of the two numbers.

### Code Explanation

The code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class maximum_between_two_numbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter two numbers: ");
        int firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();
        int secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        int maxNumber;

        if (firstNumber > secondNumber) {
            maxNumber = firstNumber;
        } else {
            maxNumber = secondNumber;
        }

        System.out.println("The maximum number is: " + maxNumber);
    }
}
```

The code first creates a `Scanner` object to read input from the user. Then, it prompts the user to enter two numbers and stores them in the variables `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`.

Next, the code declares a variable `maxNumber` to store the maximum of the two numbers. Then, it uses an `if-else` statement to determine which number is greater. If `firstNumber` is greater than `secondNumber`, then `maxNumber` is assigned the value of `firstNumber`. Otherwise, `maxNumber` is assigned the value of `secondNumber`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `maxNumber`.

### Conclusion

This code is a simple and straightforward way to find the maximum between two numbers. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment in the repository.

## Bonus

Here are some additional things to note about the code:

* The `Scanner` class is a utility class in Java that is used to read input from the user.
* The `if-else` statement is a control flow statement that is used to execute different code depending on the value of a condition.
* The `System.out.println()` method is used to print text to the console.

I hope this helps!
