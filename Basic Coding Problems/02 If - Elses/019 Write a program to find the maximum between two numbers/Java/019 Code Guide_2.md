# Here is the Code Guide for the Java program to find the maximum between two numbers:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints the maximum number.

**Code Explanation**

The code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class maximum_between_two_numbers_2 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter two numbers: ");
        int firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();
        int secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        int maxNumber = Math.max(firstNumber, secondNumber);

        System.out.println("The maximum number is: " + maxNumber);
    }
}
```

The code first imports the `java.util.Scanner` class, which is used to read input from the user. Then, it creates a `Scanner` object and uses it to read two numbers from the user.

The next step is to find the maximum number. This is done using the `Math.max()` method, which takes two numbers as input and returns the larger of the two. The `Math.max()` method is a static method, which means that it can be called without creating an instance of the `Math` class.

Finally, the maximum number is printed to the console.

**Conclusion**

This code guide has explained how to write a Java program to find the maximum between two numbers. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment on the repository.

Here are some additional details about the code:

* The `Scanner` class is a standard Java class that is used to read input from the user.
* The `Math.max()` method is a static method that is part of the `Math` class.
* The `System.out.println()` method is used to print output to the console.

I hope this Code Guide is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
