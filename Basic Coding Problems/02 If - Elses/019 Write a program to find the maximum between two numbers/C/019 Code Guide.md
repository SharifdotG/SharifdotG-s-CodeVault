# Here is the Code Guide for the program to find the maximum between two numbers:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints the maximum number.

**Code Explanation**

The code is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int first_number, second_number, max_number;

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &first_number, &second_number);

    if (first_number > second_number) {
        max_number = first_number;
    } else {
        max_number = second_number;
    }

    printf("%d is the maximum number.\n", max_number);

    return 0;
}
```

The first step is to declare three variables: `first_number`, `second_number`, and `max_number`. The `first_number` and `second_number` variables will store the two numbers that are entered by the user. The `max_number` variable will store the maximum number.

The next step is to prompt the user to enter two numbers. This is done by the following line of code:

```c
printf("Enter two numbers: ");
```

The `scanf()` function is then used to read the two numbers from the user. The following line of code does this:

```c
scanf("%d %d", &first_number, &second_number);
```

The `%d` format specifier tells the `scanf()` function to read an integer value. The `&` symbol is used to pass the address of the variable to the `scanf()` function.

The next step is to find the maximum number. This is done by the following code:

```c
if (first_number > second_number) {
    max_number = first_number;
} else {
    max_number = second_number;
}
```

This code uses the `if...else` statement to compare the two numbers. If the first number is greater than the second number, then `max_number` is assigned the value of `first_number`. Otherwise, `max_number` is assigned the value of `second_number`.

The final step is to print the maximum number. This is done by the following line of code:

```c
printf("%d is the maximum number.\n", max_number);
```

The `printf()` function is used to print the maximum number to the console. The `%d` format specifier tells the `printf()` function to print an integer value.
