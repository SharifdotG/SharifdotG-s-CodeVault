# Here is the Code Guide for the Java program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that checks whether a number is divisible by both 5 and 11.

**Code Explanation**

The code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class divisible_by_5_and_11 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();

        if (number % 5 == 0 && number % 11 == 0) {
            System.out.println(number + " is divisible by 5 and 11.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(number + " is not divisible by 5 and 11.");
        }
    }
}
```

The first line imports the `Scanner` class, which is used to read user input. The next line defines the `main()` method, which is the entry point for the program.

The `main()` method first asks the user to enter a number. The user's input is stored in the `number` variable.

The next line checks whether the `number` variable is divisible by both 5 and 11. If it is, then the program prints a message stating that the number is divisible by 5 and 11. Otherwise, the program prints a message stating that the number is not divisible by 5 and 11.

The `%` operator is used to find the remainder of a division. In this case, the `%` operator is used to find the remainder of the `number` variable divided by 5 and 11. If the remainder is 0, then the number is divisible by the divisor.

**Conclusion**

This code guide has explained how the Java program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not works. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment on the repository.
