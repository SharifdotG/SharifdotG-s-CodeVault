# Here is the Code Guide for the program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not:

**Problem**

The problem is to write a program that checks whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11. A number is divisible by 5 if the remainder of the division by 5 is 0. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference of the sum of the digits at even and odd positions is either 0 or a multiple of 11.

**Code Explanation**

The code is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int number;

    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> number;

    if (number % 5 == 0 && number % 11 == 0) {
        cout << number << " is divisible by 5 and 11." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << number << " is not divisible by 5 and 11." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The first step is to declare a variable `number` to store the number entered by the user. The next step is to prompt the user to enter a number and read the number using the `cin` statement.

The third step is to check whether the number is divisible by 5 and 11. This is done by using the `if` statement. The `if` statement checks whether the remainder of the division of `number` by 5 is 0 and whether the remainder of the division of `number` by 11 is 0. If both conditions are true, then the number is divisible by 5 and 11. Otherwise, the number is not divisible by 5 and 11.

The fourth step is to print the appropriate message. If the number is divisible by 5 and 11, then the message "number is divisible by 5 and 11." is printed. Otherwise, the message "number is not divisible by 5 and 11." is printed.

**Conclusion**

This code can be used to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11. If you have any queries, please feel free to comment in the repository.
