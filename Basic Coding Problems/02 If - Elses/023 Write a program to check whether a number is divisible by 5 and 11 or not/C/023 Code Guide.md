# Here is the guideline for the C program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not:

## Understanding the Problem

The problem is to write a C program that takes a number as input and outputs whether the number is divisible by both 5 and 11.

## Approaching the Problem

The first step is to understand the divisibility rules for 5 and 11. A number is divisible by 5 if the remainder of the number when divided by 5 is 0. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits at odd positions and the sum of the digits at even positions is either 0 or a multiple of 11.

Once we understand the divisibility rules, we can start writing the code. The first step is to declare a variable to store the number entered by the user. Then, we need to prompt the user to enter a number and read the number entered by the user.

The next step is to check if the number is divisible by both 5 and 11. We can do this by using the following code:

```c
if (number % 5 == 0 && number % 11 == 0) {

    printf("%d is divisible by 5 and 11.\n", number);
} else {

    printf("%d is not divisible by 5 and 11.\n", number);
}
```

This code first checks if the number is divisible by 5. If it is, then the code checks if the number is divisible by 11. If it is, then the code prints a message indicating that the number is divisible by both 5 and 11. Otherwise, the code prints a message indicating that the number is not divisible by 5 and 11.

## Solving the Problem

The complete code for the problem is shown below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    int number;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    if (number % 5 == 0 && number % 11 == 0) {

        printf("%d is divisible by 5 and 11.\n", number);
    } else {

        printf("%d is not divisible by 5 and 11.\n", number);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
