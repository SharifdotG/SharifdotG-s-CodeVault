# Here is the Code Guide for the program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that checks whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not. The program should first prompt the user to enter a number. Then, the program should check if the number is divisible by 5 and 11. If the number is divisible by both 5 and 11, then the program should print a message saying that the number is divisible by 5 and 11. Otherwise, the program should print a message saying that the number is not divisible by 5 and 11.

**Code Explanation**

The code for the program is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    if (number % 5 == 0 && number % 11 == 0) {
        printf("%d is divisible by 5 and 11.\n", number);
    } else {
        printf("%d is not divisible by 5 and 11.\n", number);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code, `#include <stdio.h>`, tells the compiler to include the `stdio.h` header file. This header file contains the declarations for the `printf()` and `scanf()` functions, which are used to print and read data from the console.

The next line of code, `int main()`, defines the `main()` function. This is the entry point for the program.

The next few lines of code prompt the user to enter a number and then store the number in the `number` variable.

The `if` statement checks if the `number` variable is divisible by both 5 and 11. If it is, then the `printf()` function is used to print a message saying that the number is divisible by 5 and 11. Otherwise, the `printf()` function is used to print a message saying that the number is not divisible by 5 and 11.

The last line of code, `return 0;`, returns the value 0 from the `main()` function. This indicates that the program terminated successfully.

**Conclusion**

This Code Guide should help you to understand the problem and the code for the program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment in the repository.
