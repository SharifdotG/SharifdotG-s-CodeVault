# Here is the code guide for the program to input month number and print number of days in that month:

## The Problem

The problem is to write a program that will ask the user to enter a month number, and then print the number of days in that month. The program should work for all 12 months of the year.

## Code Explanation

The code for the program is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int month;

    printf("Enter the month number: ");
    scanf("%d", &month);

    if (month == 1 || month == 3 || month == 5 || month == 7 || month == 8 || month == 10 || month == 12) {
        printf("The number of days in this month is 31.\n");
    } else if (month == 4 || month == 6 || month == 9 || month == 11) {
        printf("The number of days in this month is 30.\n");
    } else if (month == 2) {
        printf("The number of days in this month is 28 or 29.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Invalid month number.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code includes the `stdio.h` header file, which contains the declarations for the `printf()` and `scanf()` functions.

The next line of code declares the `month` variable, which will store the month number entered by the user.

The next few lines of code use the `printf()` function to prompt the user to enter a month number, and then use the `scanf()` function to read the user's input into the `month` variable.

The next few lines of code use an `if` statement to check the value of the `month` variable. If the value of `month` is equal to one of the following numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12, then the `printf()` function is used to print the message "The number of days in this month is 31."

If the value of `month` is equal to one of the following numbers: 4, 6, 9, or 11, then the `printf()` function is used to print the message "The number of days in this month is 30."

If the value of `month` is equal to 2, then the `printf()` function is used to print the message "The number of days in this month is 28 or 29."

In any other case, the `printf()` function is used to print the message "Invalid month number."

The last line of code returns the value 0, which indicates that the program has terminated successfully.

## Conclusion

This code guide has provided a detailed explanation of the program to input month number and print number of days in that month. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment in the repository.
