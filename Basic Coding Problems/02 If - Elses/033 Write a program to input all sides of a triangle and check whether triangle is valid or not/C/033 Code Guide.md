# Here is the code guide for the program to check whether a triangle is valid or not:

## The Problem

A triangle is a geometric shape with three sides. The sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. If this condition is not met, then the triangle is not valid.

The problem is to write a program that takes as input the three sides of a triangle and outputs whether the triangle is valid or not.

## Code Explanation

The code for the program is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int side_a, side_b, side_c;

    printf("Enter the three sides of a triangle: ");
    scanf("%d %d %d", &side_a, &side_b, &side_c);

    if (side_a + side_b > side_c && side_a + side_c > side_b && side_b + side_c > side_a) {
        printf("The triangle is valid.");
    } else {
        printf("The triangle is not valid.");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The first step in the code is to declare three variables to store the three sides of the triangle. The variables are named `side_a`, `side_b`, and `side_c`.

The next step is to prompt the user to enter the three sides of the triangle. The `printf()` function is used to print a message to the console. The `scanf()` function is used to read the user's input and store it in the three variables.

The next step is to check whether the triangle is valid. The `if` statement checks whether the sum of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the third side. If all three conditions are met, then the triangle is valid. Otherwise, the triangle is not valid.

The final step in the code is to print a message to the console indicating whether the triangle is valid or not. The `printf()` function is used to print a message to the console.

## Conclusion

This code guide has explained the problem and the code for the program to check whether a triangle is valid or not. I hope this code guide is helpful. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment on the repository.
