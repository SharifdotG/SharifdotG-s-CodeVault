# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that can input the three sides of a triangle and check whether the triangle is valid or not. A valid triangle is a triangle whose three sides satisfy the following conditions:

1. The sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
2. The lengths of the sides must be positive numbers.

To solve this problem, you can use the following algorithm:

1. Read the three sides of the triangle from the user.
2. Check if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the third side.
3. If any of the sides is negative, then the triangle is invalid.
4. If all of the sides are positive and the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side, then the triangle is valid.

Here is a pseudocode for the algorithm:

```
def is_triangle_valid(side1, side2, side3):
  if side1 + side2 > side3 and side1 + side3 > side2 and side2 + side3 > side1:
    return True
  else:
    return False

def main():
  side1 = int(input("Enter the first side of the triangle: "))
  side2 = int(input("Enter the second side of the triangle: "))
  side3 = int(input("Enter the third side of the triangle: "))

  if is_triangle_valid(side1, side2, side3):
    print("The triangle is valid.")
  else:
    print("The triangle is invalid.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

I hope this code hint helps you solve the problem!
