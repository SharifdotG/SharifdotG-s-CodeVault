# Here is the code guide for the problem of writing a program to input all sides of a triangle and check whether the triangle is valid or not:

## Problem

A triangle is a three-sided shape. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Otherwise, the three points cannot form a triangle.

## Code Explanation

The code first declares three variables to store the lengths of the three sides of the triangle. It then prompts the user to enter the lengths of the three sides.

The next line of code checks if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the length of the third side. If it is, then the triangle is valid. Otherwise, the triangle is not valid.

Finally, the code prints a message to the user indicating whether the triangle is valid or not.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int side_a, side_b, side_c;

    cout << "Enter the three sides of a triangle: ";
    cin >> side_a >> side_b >> side_c;

    if (side_a + side_b > side_c && side_a + side_c > side_b && side_b + side_c > side_a) {
        cout << "The triangle is valid.";
    } else {
        cout << "The triangle is not valid.";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code, `#include <iostream>`, tells the compiler to include the `iostream` header file. This header file contains the declarations for the `cout` and `cin` objects, which are used to print and read data from the console.

The second line of code, `using namespace std;`, tells the compiler to use the `std` namespace. This namespace contains all of the standard library functions and objects, including `cout` and `cin`.

The next three lines of code declare the three variables `side_a`, `side_b`, and `side_c`. These variables will store the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.

The next line of code, `cout << "Enter the three sides of a triangle: ";`, prompts the user to enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.

The next three lines of code, `cin >> side_a >> side_b >> side_c;`, read the lengths of the three sides of the triangle from the user.

The next line of code, `if (side_a + side_b > side_c && side_a + side_c > side_b && side_b + side_c > side_a)`, checks if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the length of the third side. If it is, then the triangle is valid. Otherwise, the triangle is not valid.

The last two lines of code, `cout << "The triangle is valid.";` or `cout << "The triangle is not valid.";`, print a message to the user indicating whether the triangle is valid or not.

## Conclusion

This code guide has provided a detailed explanation of the code for the problem of writing a program to input all sides of a triangle and check whether the triangle is valid or not. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment in the repository.
