# Here is the code guide for the triangle validation program:

## The Problem

A triangle is a three-sided polygon. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. If this condition is not met, then the three sides cannot form a triangle.

The problem is to write a program that inputs the lengths of the three sides of a triangle and checks whether they form a valid triangle.

## Code Explanation

The code for the triangle validation program is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class triangle_validation {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the three sides of a triangle: ");
        int sideA = scanner.nextInt();
        int sideB = scanner.nextInt();
        int sideC = scanner.nextInt();

        if (sideA + sideB > sideC && sideA + sideC > sideB && sideB + sideC > sideA) {
            System.out.println("The triangle is valid.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The triangle is not valid.");
        }
    }
}
```

The first step in the program is to create a Scanner object to read input from the user. The next step is to prompt the user to enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle. The lengths of the sides are then stored in the variables `sideA`, `sideB`, and `sideC`.

The next step is to check whether the three sides form a valid triangle. This is done by using the following three inequalities:

* `sideA + sideB > sideC`
* `sideA + sideC > sideB`
* `sideB + sideC > sideA`

If any of these inequalities is not true, then the three sides cannot form a valid triangle.

If all three inequalities are true, then the three sides form a valid triangle. In this case, the program prints the message "The triangle is valid." Otherwise, the program prints the message "The triangle is not valid."
