## Understanding the Problem

The problem is to write a C program to check whether a number is negative, positive or zero. The program should first prompt the user to enter a number. Then, the program should check whether the number is positive, negative or zero. Finally, the program should print a message indicating the type of the number.

## Approaching the Problem

The following steps can be used to approach the problem:

1. Define the variables that will be used in the program.
2. Prompt the user to enter a number.
3. Read the number from the user.
4. Check whether the number is positive, negative or zero.
5. Print a message indicating the type of the number.

## Solving the Problem

The following code solves the problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    int number;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    if (number > 0) {
        printf("The number is positive.");
    }
    else if (number < 0) {
        printf("The number is negative.");
    }
    else {
        printf("The number is zero.");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The code first defines the variables `number` to store the number entered by the user. Then, the code prompts the user to enter a number and reads the number from the user. Next, the code checks whether the number is positive, negative or zero using the following if statements:

```c
if (number > 0) {
    printf("The number is positive.");
}
else if (number < 0) {
    printf("The number is negative.");
}
else {
    printf("The number is zero.");
}
```

Finally, the code prints a message indicating the type of the number.
