Sure, here is the Code Hint for the problem "Write a program to find a maximum between four numbers":


**CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!**

This problem asks you to write a program to find the maximum between four numbers. The problem can be solved using the following steps:

1. **Declare four variables to store the four numbers.**
2. **Write a loop to compare the four numbers.**
3. **Find the maximum number and store it in a variable.**
4. **Print the maximum number.**

Here is an algorithm for the problem:

```
1. Declare four variables to store the four numbers.
2. Initialize a variable to store the maximum number.
3. Compare the four numbers and update the maximum number variable if necessary.
4. Print the maximum number variable.
```

Here is a pseudocode for the problem:

```
procedure find_maximum(a, b, c, d)
  max := a
  if b > max then
    max := b
  if c > max then
    max := c
  if d > max then
    max := d
  return max
end procedure
```

I hope this helps!
