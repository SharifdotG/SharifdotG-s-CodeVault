# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that checks whether a number is negative, positive or zero. The program should take a number as input and then print out one of the following messages:

* "The number is positive."
* "The number is negative."
* "The number is zero."

To solve this problem, you will need to use the following concepts:

* Conditional statements (if, else, else if)
* Input/output (reading and printing data)

Here is an algorithm for solving the problem:

1. Read a number from the user.
2. If the number is greater than 0, then print "The number is positive."
3. If the number is less than 0, then print "The number is negative."
4. Otherwise, the number is equal to 0, so print "The number is zero."

Here is a pseudocode for solving the problem:

```
procedure check_number(number)
  if number > 0 then
    print("The number is positive.")
  else if number < 0 then
    print("The number is negative.")
  else
    print("The number is zero.")
end procedure
```

I hope this Code Hint helps you solve the problem!
