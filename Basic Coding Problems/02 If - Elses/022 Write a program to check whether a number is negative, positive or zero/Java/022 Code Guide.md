# Here is the code guide for the problem of checking whether a number is negative, positive, or zero:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that takes a number as input and prints whether the number is negative, positive, or zero.

**Code Explanation**

The code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class check_number_type {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();

        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is positive.");
        } else if (number < 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is negative.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The number is zero.");
        }
    }
}
```

The first line imports the `Scanner` class, which is used to read input from the user. The next line declares a `Scanner` object called `scanner`.

The next line prints a message to the user asking them to enter a number. The user's input is then stored in the `number` variable.

The next three lines use the `if` statement to check whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. If the number is positive, the `if` statement prints the message "The number is positive." If the number is negative, the `else if` statement prints the message "The number is negative." If the number is zero, the `else` statement prints the message "The number is zero."

The last line is the closing brace for the `main()` method.

**Conclusion**

This code can be used to check whether a number is negative, positive, or zero. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment on the repository.
