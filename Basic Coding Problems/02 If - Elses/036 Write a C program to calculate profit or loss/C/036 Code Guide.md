# Here is the detailed guideline for the problem:

**Understanding the problem**

The problem is to write a C program to calculate profit or loss. The program will take the cost price and selling price of an item as input, and then calculate the profit or loss. If the selling price is greater than the cost price, then the profit is calculated. Otherwise, the loss is calculated. If the cost price and selling price are equal, then no profit or loss is calculated.

**Approaching the problem**

The first step to approaching this problem is to define the variables that will be used. The following variables will be used in the program:

* `cost_price`: The cost price of the item.
* `selling_price`: The selling price of the item.
* `profit`: The profit made on the item.
* `loss`: The loss made on the item.

The next step is to write the code to calculate the profit or loss. The following code can be used to calculate the profit:

```c
if (selling_price > cost_price) {
    profit = selling_price - cost_price;
}
```

The following code can be used to calculate the loss:

```c
else if (cost_price > selling_price) {
    loss = cost_price - selling_price;
}
```

The final step is to write the code to print the result. The following code can be used to print the result:

```c
if (profit > 0) {
    printf("Profit is %d\n", profit);
} else if (loss > 0) {
    printf("Loss is %d\n", loss);
} else {
    printf("No profit no loss\n");
}
```

**Solving the problem**

The code to solve the problem is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    int cost_price;
    int selling_price;
    int profit;
    int loss;

    printf("Enter the cost price: ");
    scanf("%d", &cost_price);

    printf("Enter the selling price: ");
    scanf("%d", &selling_price);

    if (selling_price > cost_price) {
        profit = selling_price - cost_price;
    } else if (cost_price > selling_price) {
        loss = cost_price - selling_price;
    } else {
        printf("No profit no loss\n");
    }

    if (profit > 0) {
        printf("Profit is %d\n", profit);
    } else if (loss > 0) {
        printf("Loss is %d\n", loss);
    } else {
        printf("No profit no loss\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**How the code works**

The code first prompts the user to enter the cost price and selling price of the item. The code then uses an `if` statement to check if the selling price is greater than the cost price. If it is, then the profit is calculated and printed. Otherwise, the loss is calculated and printed. If the cost price and selling price are equal, then the message `No profit no loss` is printed.
