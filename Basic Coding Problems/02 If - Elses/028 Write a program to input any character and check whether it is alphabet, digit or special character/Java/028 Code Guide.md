# Here is the code guide for the program to input any character and check whether it is alphabet, digit or special character:

## The Problem

The problem is to write a program that can input any character from the user and check whether it is an alphabet, a digit, or a special character.

## Code Explanation

The code for the program is as follows:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class check_character {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter any character: ");
        char character = scanner.next().charAt(0);

        if (Character.isAlphabetic(character)) {
            System.out.println("The character is an alphabet.");
        } else if (Character.isDigit(character)) {
            System.out.println("The character is a digit.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The character is a special character.");
        }
    }
}
```

The first line imports the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package. This class allows us to read input from the user.

The next line declares a `Scanner` object called `scanner`.

The following line prints a message to the user asking them to enter a character.

The next line reads the user's input and stores it in the `character` variable.

The next line uses the `Character.isAlphabetic()` method to check whether the `character` variable is an alphabet. If it is, the program prints a message saying "The character is an alphabet."

The next line uses the `Character.isDigit()` method to check whether the `character` variable is a digit. If it is, the program prints a message saying "The character is a digit."

The last line uses the `Character.isAlphabetic()` method to check whether the `character` variable is a special character. If it is, the program prints a message saying "The character is a special character."

## Conclusion

This program can be used to check whether any character entered by the user is an alphabet, a digit, or a special character. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment on the repository.

I hope this code guide is helpful.
