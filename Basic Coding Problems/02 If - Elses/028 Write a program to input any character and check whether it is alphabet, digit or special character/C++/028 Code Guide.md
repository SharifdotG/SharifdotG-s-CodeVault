# Here is the code guide for the problem of "Write a program to input any character and check whether it is alphabet, digit or special character":

## Problem

The problem is to write a program that can input any character and check whether it is an alphabet, a digit, or a special character.

## Code Explanation

The code for this problem is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    char character;

    cout << "Enter any character: ";
    cin >> character;

    if (isalpha(character)) {
        cout << "The character is an alphabet.";
    } else if (isdigit(character)) {
        cout << "The character is a digit.";
    } else {
        cout << "The character is a special character.";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code `#include <iostream>` includes the `iostream` header file, which contains the definitions for the `cout` and `cin` objects. The `using namespace std;` statement tells the compiler to use the names from the `std` namespace without having to prefix them with `std::`.

The `int main() {` and `}` statements define the main function of the program. The `main()` function is where the program's execution starts and ends.

The `char character;` statement declares a variable called `character` of type `char`. A `char` variable can store a single character.

The `cout << "Enter any character: ";` statement prints the message "Enter any character: " to the console.

The `cin >> character;` statement reads a character from the console and stores it in the `character` variable.

The `if (isalpha(character)) {` statement checks if the character stored in the `character` variable is an alphabet. The `isalpha()` function returns `true` if the character is an alphabet, and `false` otherwise.

If the `isalpha()` function returns `true`, the `cout << "The character is an alphabet.";` statement prints the message "The character is an alphabet." to the console.

If the `isalpha()` function returns `false`, the `if (isdigit(character)) {` statement checks if the character stored in the `character` variable is a digit. The `isdigit()` function returns `true` if the character is a digit, and `false` otherwise.

If the `isdigit()` function returns `true`, the `cout << "The character is a digit.";` statement prints the message "The character is a digit." to the console.

If the `isalpha()` and `isdigit()` functions both return `false`, then the character stored in the `character` variable is a special character. In this case, the `cout << "The character is a special character.";` statement prints the message "The character is a special character." to the console.

The `return 0;` statement is the end of the main function. It tells the compiler that the program has finished executing successfully.
