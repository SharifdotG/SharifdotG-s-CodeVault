## Understanding the Problem

The problem is to write a C program that can input any character and check whether it is an alphabet, digit, or special character.

The first step to solving this problem is to understand the different types of characters that can be input. There are three main types of characters:

* **Alphabets:** These are the letters of the alphabet, both uppercase and lowercase.
* **Digits:** These are the numbers from 0 to 9.
* **Special characters:** These are any other characters that are not alphabets or digits.

Once we understand the different types of characters, we can start to write the code to check for them.

## Approaching the Problem

The approach to solving this problem is to use a series of if statements to check if the character is an alphabet, a digit, or a special character.

The first if statement will check if the character is in the range of lowercase alphabets ('a' to 'z'). If it is, then the character is an alphabet.

The second if statement will check if the character is in the range of uppercase alphabets ('A' to 'Z'). If it is, then the character is an alphabet.

The third if statement will check if the character is in the range of digits ('0' to '9'). If it is, then the character is a digit.

If the character is not in any of these ranges, then it is a special character.

## Solving the Problem

The code to solve the problem is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  char character;

  printf("Enter any character: ");
  scanf("%c", &character);

  if (character >= 'a' && character <= 'z' || character >= 'A' && character <= 'Z') {
    printf("The character is an alphabet.");
  }
  else if (character >= '0' && character <= '9') {
    printf("The character is a digit.");
  }
  else {
    printf("The character is a special character.");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This code first prompts the user to enter a character. Then, it reads the character from the user and stores it in the variable `character`.

Next, the code uses a series of if statements to check if the character is an alphabet, a digit, or a special character. If the character is an alphabet, then the code prints the message `The character is an alphabet.`. If the character is a digit, then the code prints the message `The character is a digit.`. If the character is a special character, then the code prints the message `The character is a special character.`.

Finally, the code returns 0 to indicate that the program has completed successfully.
