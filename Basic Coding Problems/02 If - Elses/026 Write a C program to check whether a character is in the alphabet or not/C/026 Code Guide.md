# Here is the guideline for the C program to check whether a character is in the alphabet or not:

**Understanding the problem**

The problem is to write a C program that takes a character as input and prints whether the character is in the alphabet or not. The alphabet in this case is the English alphabet, which consists of the lowercase letters `a` through `z` and the uppercase letters `A` through `Z`.

**Approaching the problem**

The first step is to prompt the user to enter a character. This can be done using the `printf()` function. The next step is to read the character entered by the user. This can be done using the `scanf()` function.

Once the character has been read, we need to check if it is in the alphabet. We can do this by comparing the character to the ASCII values of the lowercase and uppercase letters in the alphabet. If the character's ASCII value is between the ASCII values of `a` and `z` or between the ASCII values of `A` and `Z`, then the character is in the alphabet. Otherwise, the character is not in the alphabet.

**Solving the problem**

The code below solves the problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  char character;

  printf("Enter a character: ");
  scanf("%c", &character);

  if (character >= 'a' && character <= 'z' || character >= 'A' && character <= 'Z') {
    printf("%c is in the alphabet.\n", character);
  } else {
    printf("%c is not in the alphabet.\n", character);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The code first defines a variable `character` to store the character entered by the user. Then, it prompts the user to enter a character and reads the character using the `scanf()` function.

Next, the code checks if the character is in the alphabet. It does this by comparing the character's ASCII value to the ASCII values of the lowercase and uppercase letters in the alphabet. If the character's ASCII value is between the ASCII values of `a` and `z` or between the ASCII values of `A` and `Z`, then the character is in the alphabet. Otherwise, the character is not in the alphabet.

Finally, the code prints a message indicating whether the character is in the alphabet or not.

**Conclusion**

This is a simple C program that can be used to check whether a character is in the alphabet or not. The code is well-documented and easy to understand. If you are new to C programming, this is a good program to start with.
