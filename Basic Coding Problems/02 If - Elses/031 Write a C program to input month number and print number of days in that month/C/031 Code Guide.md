## Understanding the problem

The first step to solving any coding problem is to understand the problem. In this case, the problem is to write a C program that will input a month number and print the number of days in that month.

To understand the problem, we need to know how many days are in each month. The following table shows the number of days in each month:

Month | Number of days
------- | --------
January | 31
February | 28 or 29
March | 31
April | 30
May | 31
June | 30
July | 31
August | 31
September | 30
October | 31
November | 30
December | 31

## Approaching the problem

The first step is to define a variable to store the month number. Then, we need to write a series of if statements to check if the month number is equal to 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12. If it is, we print "The number of days in this month is 31". If the month number is equal to 4, 6, 9, or 11, we print "The number of days in this month is 30". And if the month number is equal to 2, we print "The number of days in this month is 28 or 29".

Finally, if the month number is not equal to any of the values listed above, we print `Invalid month number`.

## Solving the problem

The following code solves the problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int month;

  printf("Enter the month number: ");
  scanf("%d", &month);

  if (month == 1 || month == 3 || month == 5 || month == 7 || month == 8 || month == 10 || month == 12) {
    printf("The number of days in this month is 31.\n");
  } else if (month == 4 || month == 6 || month == 9 || month == 11) {
    printf("The number of days in this month is 30.\n");
  } else if (month == 2) {
    printf("The number of days in this month is 28 or 29.\n");
  } else {
    printf("Invalid month number.\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This code first prompts the user to enter the month number. Then, it checks if the month number is valid. If it is, the code prints the number of days in the month. If the month number is invalid, the code prints a message indicating that the month number is invalid.
