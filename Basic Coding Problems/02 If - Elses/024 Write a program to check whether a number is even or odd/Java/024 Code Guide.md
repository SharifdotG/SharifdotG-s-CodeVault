# Here is the Code Guide for your Java program to check whether a number is even or odd:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that checks whether a number is even or odd. An even number is a number that is divisible by 2, while an odd number is a number that is not divisible by 2.

**Code Explanation**

The code for this problem is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class even_or_odd {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();

        if (number % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println(number + " is even.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(number + " is odd.");
        }
    }
}
```

The code first imports the `java.util.Scanner` class, which is used to read input from the user. Then, it creates a new `Scanner` object and uses it to read an integer from the user. The integer is then stored in the `number` variable.

The next line of code uses the `%` operator to check whether the `number` variable is divisible by 2. If it is, the `if` statement is executed and the message "number is even." is printed to the console. Otherwise, the `else` statement is executed and the message "number is odd." is printed to the console.

**Conclusion**

This code is a simple way to check whether a number is even or odd. The code is well-formatted and easy to understand. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment in the repository.
