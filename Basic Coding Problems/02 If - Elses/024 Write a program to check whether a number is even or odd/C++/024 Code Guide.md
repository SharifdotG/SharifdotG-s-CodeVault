# Here is the Code Guide for the program to check whether a number is even or odd:

**The Problem**

The problem is to write a program that can determine whether a number is even or odd. An even number is a number that is divisible by 2, while an odd number is a number that is not divisible by 2.

**Code Explanation**

The code for the program is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int number;

    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> number;

    if (number % 2 == 0) {
        cout << number << " is even." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << number << " is odd." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code, `#include <iostream>`, tells the compiler to include the `iostream` header file. This header file contains the definition of the `cin` and `cout` objects, which are used to read and write data to the console.

The next line of code, `using namespace std;`, tells the compiler to use the `std` namespace. This namespace contains all of the standard library functions, including `cin` and `cout`.

The `main()` function is the entry point for the program. The first line of the `main()` function, `cout << "Enter a number: ";`, displays a message to the console asking the user to enter a number. The next line, `cin >> number;`, reads the number entered by the user and stores it in the `number` variable.

The next line of code, `if (number % 2 == 0)`, checks whether the `number` variable is divisible by 2. If it is, the `cout << number << " is even." << endl;` statement is executed. This statement displays the message "number is even." to the console. Otherwise, the `cout << number << " is odd." << endl;` statement is executed. This statement displays the message "number is odd." to the console.

The last line of code, `return 0;`, returns the value 0 from the `main()` function. This indicates that the program has terminated successfully.

**Conclusion**

This code guide has explained how to write a program to check whether a number is even or odd. The code is highly detailed and concise, so that everyone can understand it without any issues. If you have any queries, please feel free to comment in the repository.
