**Problem: Write a program to check whether a number is even or odd.**

**General Information**

* An even number is a number that is divisible by 2.
* An odd number is a number that is not divisible by 2.
* To check whether a number is even or odd, we can use the modulus operator (%).
* The modulus operator returns the remainder when a number is divided by another number.
* If the remainder is 0, then the number is even.
* If the remainder is not 0, then the number is odd.

**Tips and Tricks**

* You can use the following algorithm to check whether a number is even or odd:

```
1. Get the input number from the user.
2. Calculate the remainder of the number when divided by 2.
3. If the remainder is 0, then the number is even.
4. If the remainder is not 0, then the number is odd.
```

* You can also use the following pseudocode to check whether a number is even or odd:

```
procedure check_even_odd(number)
  remainder := number % 2
  if remainder = 0 then
    print("The number is even.")
  else
    print("The number is odd.")
end procedure
```
