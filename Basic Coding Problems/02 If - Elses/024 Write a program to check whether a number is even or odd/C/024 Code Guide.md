# Here is a detailed guideline for the problem:

**Understanding the problem**

The problem asks us to write a C program to check whether a number is even or odd. In other words, we need to determine whether the number is divisible by 2.

**Approaching the problem**

There are a few ways to approach this problem. One way is to use the modulus operator (%). The modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 2 = 0, because 10 is divisible by 2 with no remainder. Therefore, we can use the modulus operator to check whether a number is even or odd.

Another way to approach this problem is to use the bitwise AND operator (&). The bitwise AND operator returns 1 if the two bits being compared are both 1, and 0 otherwise. For example, 10 & 1 = 0, because the least significant bit of 10 is 0. Therefore, we can use the bitwise AND operator to check whether the least significant bit of a number is 1.

**Solving the problem**

The code below solves the problem using the modulus operator:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int number;

  printf("Enter a number: ");
  scanf("%d", &number);

  if (number % 2 == 0) {
    printf("%d is even.\n", number);
  } else {
    printf("%d is odd.\n", number);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The code first prompts the user to enter a number. Then, it uses the `scanf()` function to read the number from the user. Next, the code uses the `modulus operator` to check whether the number is even or odd. If the number is even, the code prints a message saying that the number is even. Otherwise, the code prints a message saying that the number is odd.

**Comments**

The code is well-commented, which makes it easy to understand. The comments explain what each part of the code does, which is helpful for beginners who are learning C.
