# Here is the Code Guide for the leap year program:

**The Problem**

A leap year is a year that has 366 days instead of the usual 365 days. Leap years occur every four years, except for century years that are not divisible by 400.

**Code Explanation**

The code to check whether a year is a leap year is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int year;

    cout << "Enter a year: ";
    cin >> year;

    if (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0) {
        cout << year << " is a leap year\n";
    } else {
        cout << year << " is not a leap year\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The first step is to declare a variable `year` to store the year that the user enters.

The next step is to use a `cout` statement to prompt the user to enter a year.

The third step is to use a `cin` statement to read the user's input and store it in the `year` variable.

The fourth step is to use an `if` statement to check whether the year is a leap year. The `if` statement checks whether the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, or whether the year is divisible by 400. If the year meets either of these conditions, then it is a leap year.

The fifth step is to use a `cout` statement to print a message indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.

The sixth step is to return the value 0 from the `main()` function.

**Conclusion**

This code can be used to check whether a year is a leap year. If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to comment in the repository.
