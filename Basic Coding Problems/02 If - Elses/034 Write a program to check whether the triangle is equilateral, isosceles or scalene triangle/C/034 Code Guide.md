# Here is the code guide for the problem of checking whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene:

## The Problem

A triangle is a polygon with three sides and three vertices. The sides of a triangle are connected to each other at their vertices. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

There are three types of triangles: equilateral, isosceles, and scalene.

* An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length.
* An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length.
* A scalene triangle has no sides of equal length.

## Code Explanation

The code below checks whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int side_a, side_b, side_c;

    printf("Enter the three sides of the triangle: ");
    scanf("%d %d %d", &side_a, &side_b, &side_c);

    if (side_a == side_b && side_b == side_c) {
        printf("The triangle is equilateral.\n");
    } else if (side_a == side_b || side_a == side_c || side_b == side_c) {
        printf("The triangle is isosceles.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The triangle is scalene.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The first step in the code is to declare three variables, `side_a`, `side_b`, and `side_c`, to store the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.

The next step is to prompt the user to enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle. The user's input is then stored in the `side_a`, `side_b`, and `side_c` variables.

The next step is to check whether the triangle is equilateral. This is done by checking if all three sides of the triangle are equal. If all three sides are equal, then the `if` statement is executed and the message "The triangle is equilateral." is printed to the console.

If the triangle is not equilateral, then the `if` statement is skipped and the next step is to check whether the triangle is isosceles. This is done by checking if any two sides of the triangle are equal. If any two sides are equal, then the `else if` statement is executed and the message "The triangle is isosceles." is printed to the console.

If the triangle is not equilateral or isosceles, then it must be scalene. This is because the only other type of triangle is scalene, and if the triangle is not equilateral or isosceles, then it must be scalene. Therefore, the `else` statement is executed and the message "The triangle is scalene." is printed to the console.

The final step in the code is to return 0, which indicates that the program has completed successfully.
