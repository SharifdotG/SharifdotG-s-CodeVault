# Here is the code guide for the program to find all roots of a quadratic equation:

## The Problem

A quadratic equation is an equation of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are real numbers and `a` is not equal to 0. The roots of a quadratic equation are the values of `x` that satisfy the equation.

## Code Explanation

The code to find all roots of a quadratic equation is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class quadratic_equation {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the value of a, b, c: ");
        float a = scanner.nextFloat();
        float b = scanner.nextFloat();
        float c = scanner.nextFloat();

        float discriminant = b * b - 4 * a * c;

        if (discriminant > 0) {
            float root1 = (float) ((-b + Math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a));
            float root2 = (float) ((-b - Math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a));
            System.out.println("The roots are: " + root1 + " and " + root2);
        } else if (discriminant == 0) {
            float root2;
            float root1 = root2 = -b / (2 * a);
            System.out.println("The roots are: " + root1 + " and " + root2);
        } else {
            float realPart = -b / (2 * a);
            float imaginaryPart = (float) (Math.sqrt(-discriminant) / (2 * a));
            System.out.println("The roots are: " + realPart + " + " + imaginaryPart + "i and " + realPart + " - " + imaginaryPart + "i");
        }
    }
}
```

The first step is to declare the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` to store the coefficients of the quadratic equation. The next step is to create a Scanner object to read the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user.

The next step is to calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which is given by `b^2 - 4ac`. The discriminant determines the number of roots of the quadratic equation. If the discriminant is greater than 0, then the quadratic equation has two real roots. If the discriminant is equal to 0, then the quadratic equation has one repeated real root. If the discriminant is less than 0, then the quadratic equation has two complex roots.

The next step is to use the discriminant to determine the roots of the quadratic equation. If the discriminant is greater than 0, then the roots are given by `(-b + Math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)` and `(-b - Math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)`. If the discriminant is equal to 0, then the root is given by `-b / (2 * a)`. If the discriminant is less than 0, then the roots are given by `(-b / (2 * a)) + (i * Math.sqrt(-discriminant)) / (2 * a)` and `(-b / (2 * a)) - (i * Math.sqrt(-discriminant)) / (2 * a)`, where `i` is the imaginary unit.

The final step is to print the roots of the quadratic equation.
