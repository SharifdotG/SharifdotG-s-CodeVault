# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

A quadratic equation is an equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are real numbers and a is not equal to 0. The roots of a quadratic equation are the values of x that satisfy the equation.

To find the roots of a quadratic equation, you can use the following formula:

```
x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
```

where:

* x is the root of the quadratic equation
* b is the coefficient of the x term
* c is the constant term
* a is the leading coefficient

The discriminant, b^2 - 4ac, determines the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation. If the discriminant is greater than 0, then the roots are real and distinct. If the discriminant is equal to 0, then the roots are real and equal. If the discriminant is less than 0, then the roots are complex and conjugate.

Here is an algorithm for finding the roots of a quadratic equation:

1. Calculate the discriminant, b^2 - 4ac.
2. If the discriminant is greater than 0, then the roots are real and distinct. Calculate the roots using the formula x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.
3. If the discriminant is equal to 0, then the roots are real and equal. The only root is x = -b / 2a.
4. If the discriminant is less than 0, then the roots are complex and conjugate. The roots are x = (-b ± √(-b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.

Here is a pseudocode for finding the roots of a quadratic equation:

```
function find_roots(a, b, c):
  discriminant = b^2 - 4ac
  if discriminant > 0:
    root1 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / 2a
    root2 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / 2a
    return root1, root2
  elif discriminant == 0:
    root = -b / 2a
    return root
  else:
    root1 = (-b + sqrt(-discriminant)) / 2a
    root2 = (-b - sqrt(-discriminant)) / 2a
    return root1, root2
```

I hope this code hint helps you solve the problem of writing a program to find all roots of a quadratic equation!
