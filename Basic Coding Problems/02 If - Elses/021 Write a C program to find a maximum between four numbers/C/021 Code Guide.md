# Here is the guideline for the C program to find a maximum between four numbers:

**Understanding the problem**

The problem is to write a C program that finds the maximum number between four numbers. The program should first prompt the user to enter four numbers. Then, it should compare the numbers and print the maximum number.

**Approaching the problem**

The first step is to declare four variables to store the four numbers entered by the user. Then, the program should prompt the user to enter the four numbers. Once the numbers have been entered, the program should compare them and find the maximum number. The maximum number can be found by using a series of if statements.

**Solving the problem**

The following code shows how to solve the problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int first_number;
  int second_number;
  int third_number;
  int fourth_number;

  printf("Enter four numbers:\n");
  scanf("%d %d %d %d", &first_number, &second_number, &third_number, &fourth_number);

  if (first_number > second_number && first_number > third_number && first_number > fourth_number) {
    printf("%d is the maximum number.\n", first_number);
  } else if (second_number > first_number && second_number > third_number && second_number > fourth_number) {
    printf("%d is the maximum number.\n", second_number);
  } else if (third_number > first_number && third_number > second_number && third_number > fourth_number) {
    printf("%d is the maximum number.\n", third_number);
  } else {
    printf("%d is the maximum number.\n", fourth_number);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This code first declares four variables to store the four numbers entered by the user. Then, the program prompts the user to enter the four numbers. Once the numbers have been entered, the program compares them and finds the maximum number. The maximum number is printed by the last printf statement.

**Testing the program**

The program can be tested by entering four different numbers. The program should print the maximum number among the four numbers entered.

**Asking for help**

If you have any questions about the program, you can ask for help in the SharifdotG's CodeVault repository. You can also post a comment on the repository and someone will help you.

I hope this guideline is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
