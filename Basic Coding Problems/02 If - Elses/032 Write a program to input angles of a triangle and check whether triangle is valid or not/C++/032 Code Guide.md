# Here is the code guide for the triangle validity program:

## The Problem

A triangle is a polygon with three sides and three angles. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always equal to 180 degrees. A triangle is considered valid if the sum of its three angles is equal to 180 degrees and all three angles are greater than 0 degrees.

## Code Explanation

The code for the triangle validity program is as follows:

```python
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int angle_a, angle_b, angle_c;

    cout << "Enter the angles of the triangle: ";
    cin >> angle_a >> angle_b >> angle_c;

    if (angle_a + angle_b + angle_c == 180 && angle_a > 0 && angle_b > 0 && angle_c > 0) {
        cout << "The triangle is valid.";
    } else {
        cout << "The triangle is not valid.";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code includes the `iostream` header file, which contains the `cout` and `cin` objects that are used to print and read data from the console.

The next line of code uses the `using namespace std` statement to import all of the names from the `std` namespace into the current scope. This makes it easier to write the code, as we don't have to write the full name of each object every time we want to use it.

The `main()` function is the entry point for the program. It first declares three variables to store the angles of the triangle. It then uses the `cout` object to print a message to the console asking the user to enter the angles of the triangle. The user's input is then read into the three variables using the `cin` object.

The next line of code uses the `if` statement to check if the sum of the three angles is equal to 180 degrees and all three angles are greater than 0 degrees. If both of these conditions are met, the `cout` object is used to print a message to the console stating that the triangle is valid. Otherwise, the `cout` object is used to print a message to the console stating that the triangle is not valid.

The `return 0` statement at the end of the `main()` function tells the operating system that the program has successfully completed.
