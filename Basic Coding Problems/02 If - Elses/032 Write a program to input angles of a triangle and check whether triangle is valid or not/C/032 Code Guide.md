# Here is the guideline for the problem:

**Problem Understanding**

The problem is to write a C program to input angles of a triangle and check whether triangle is valid or not. A valid triangle is a triangle whose three angles add up to 180 degrees.

**Approach**

The approach to solving this problem is to first prompt the user to enter the angles of the triangle. Then, the program will read the angles from the user and check whether they form a valid triangle. A triangle is valid if the sum of its three angles is 180 degrees, and all three angles are positive.

**Solution**

The solution to this problem is the following C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    int angle_a, angle_b, angle_c;

    printf("Enter the angles of the triangle: ");
    scanf("%d %d %d", &angle_a, &angle_b, &angle_c);

    if (angle_a + angle_b + angle_c == 180 && angle_a > 0 && angle_b > 0 && angle_c > 0) {
        printf("The triangle is valid.");
    } else {
        printf("The triangle is not valid.");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This program first declares three variables to store the angles of the triangle. Then, it prompts the user to enter the angles of the triangle. Next, it reads the angles from the user and checks whether they form a valid triangle. If the angles form a valid triangle, the program prints "The triangle is valid.". Otherwise, the program prints "The triangle is not valid.".

**Code Explanation**

The code for this problem is fairly straightforward. The main function first declares three variables to store the angles of the triangle. Then, it prompts the user to enter the angles of the triangle. Next, it reads the angles from the user and checks whether they form a valid triangle. The check for a valid triangle is done using the following code:

```c
if (angle_a + angle_b + angle_c == 180 && angle_a > 0 && angle_b > 0 && angle_c > 0) {
    printf("The triangle is valid.");
} else {
    printf("The triangle is not valid.");
}
```

This code checks whether the sum of the three angles is 180 degrees, and whether all three angles are positive. If both of these conditions are met, then the triangle is valid. Otherwise, the triangle is not valid.
