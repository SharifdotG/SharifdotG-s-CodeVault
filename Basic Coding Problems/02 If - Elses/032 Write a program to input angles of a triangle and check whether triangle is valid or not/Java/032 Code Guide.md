# Here is the code guide for the triangle validity program:

## The Problem

A triangle is a polygon with three sides and three angles. The sum of the three angles in a triangle is always equal to 180 degrees. A triangle is valid if and only if the sum of any two of its angles is greater than the third angle.

## Code Explanation

The code for the triangle validity program is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class triangle_validity {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the angles of the triangle: ");
        int angleA = scanner.nextInt();
        int angleB = scanner.nextInt();
        int angleC = scanner.nextInt();

        if (angleA + angleB + angleC == 180 && angleA > 0 && angleB > 0 && angleC > 0) {
            System.out.println("The triangle is valid.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The triangle is not valid.");
        }
    }
}
```

The first line imports the `Scanner` class, which is used to read user input. The next line declares a `Scanner` object named `scanner`.

The next line prompts the user to enter the angles of the triangle. The angles are stored in the variables `angleA`, `angleB`, and `angleC`.

The next line checks if the sum of the three angles is equal to 180 degrees. If it is, then the triangle is valid. Otherwise, the triangle is not valid.

The next line checks if each of the angles is greater than 0 degrees. If any of the angles is less than or equal to 0 degrees, then the triangle is not valid.

The last line prints a message indicating whether the triangle is valid or not.
