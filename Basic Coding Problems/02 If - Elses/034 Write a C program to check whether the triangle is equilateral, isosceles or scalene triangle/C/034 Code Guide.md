# Here is a detailed guideline for the problem:

**Understanding the problem**

The problem asks you to write a C program to check whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal, an isosceles triangle has two sides equal, and a scalene triangle has no sides equal.

**Approaching the problem**

The first step is to declare three variables to store the three sides of the triangle. Then, you need to prompt the user to enter the three sides of the triangle. Once you have the three sides of the triangle, you can check if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

**Solving the problem**

To check if the triangle is equilateral, you can use the following code:

```c
if (side_a == side_b && side_b == side_c) {
    printf("The triangle is equilateral.\n");
}
```

This code checks if all three sides of the triangle are equal. If they are, then the triangle is equilateral.

To check if the triangle is isosceles, you can use the following code:

```c
else if (side_a == side_b || side_a == side_c || side_b == side_c) {
    printf("The triangle is isosceles.\n");
}
```

This code checks if any two of the sides of the triangle are equal. If any two sides are equal, then the triangle is isosceles.

If the triangle is not equilateral or isosceles, then it must be scalene. You can check this by using the following code:

```c
else {
    printf("The triangle is scalene.\n");
}
```

This code prints a message that the triangle is scalene if the triangle is not equilateral or isosceles.

**Explaining how the code works**

The code works by first declaring three variables to store the three sides of the triangle. Then, it prompts the user to enter the three sides of the triangle. Once the three sides of the triangle are entered, the code checks if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. If the triangle is equilateral, the code prints a message that the triangle is equilateral. If the triangle is isosceles, the code prints a message that the triangle is isosceles. If the triangle is scalene, the code prints a message that the triangle is scalene.
