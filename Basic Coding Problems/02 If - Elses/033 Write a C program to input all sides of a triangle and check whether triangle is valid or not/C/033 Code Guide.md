# Here is a detailed guideline for the problem:

**Understanding the problem**

The problem is to write a C program to input all sides of a triangle and check whether the triangle is valid or not. A valid triangle is a triangle in which the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.

**Approaching the problem**

The first step is to declare three variables to store the three sides of the triangle. The next step is to prompt the user to enter the three sides of the triangle. Then, we can use the following logic to check if the triangle is valid:

```c
int is_valid = (side_a + side_b > side_c) && (side_a + side_c > side_b) && (side_b + side_c > side_a);
```

This logic checks if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the third side. If it is, then the triangle is valid. Otherwise, the triangle is not valid.

**Solving the problem**

The code below solves the problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int side_a, side_b, side_c;

    printf("Enter the three sides of a triangle: ");
    scanf("%d %d %d", &side_a, &side_b, &side_c);

    int is_valid = (side_a + side_b > side_c) && (side_a + side_c > side_b) && (side_b + side_c > side_a);

    if (is_valid) {
        printf("The triangle is valid.");
    } else {
        printf("The triangle is not valid.");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code first declares three variables to store the three sides of the triangle. Then, it prompts the user to enter the three sides of the triangle. Next, it uses the logic mentioned above to check if the triangle is valid. Finally, it prints a message indicating whether the triangle is valid or not.

**Explaining the code**

The code above is well-commented, so it should be easy to understand. However, here is a brief explanation of the code:

* The `main()` function first declares three variables to store the three sides of the triangle.
* Then, it prompts the user to enter the three sides of the triangle.
* Next, it uses the `is_valid` variable to check if the triangle is valid. The `is_valid` variable is initialized to 0. If the sum of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the third side, then the `is_valid` variable is set to 1. Otherwise, the `is_valid` variable remains at 0.
* Finally, the code prints a message indicating whether the triangle is valid or not.
