# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that will input a week number and print the corresponding day of the week. The week number is an integer between 1 and 7, where 1 represents Monday, 2 represents Tuesday, and so on.

To solve this problem, you can use the following steps:

1. **Define a variable to store the week number.**
2. **Use a conditional statement to check the week number.**
3. **Print the corresponding day of the week.**

Here is an example of an algorithm for this problem:

```
1. Start the program.
2. Define a variable `week_number` to store the week number.
3. Use a `if` statement to check the `week_number`.
    * If `week_number` is 1, print "Monday".
    * If `week_number` is 2, print "Tuesday".
    * ...
    * If `week_number` is 7, print "Sunday".
4. End the program.
```

Here is an example of pseudocode for this problem:

```
// Define a variable to store the week number
week_number = input("Enter the week number: ")

// Use a conditional statement to check the week number
if week_number == 1:
  print("Monday")
elif week_number == 2:
  print("Tuesday")
elif week_number == 3:
  print("Wednesday")
elif week_number == 4:
  print("Thursday")
elif week_number == 5:
  print("Friday")
elif week_number == 6:
  print("Saturday")
else:
  print("Sunday")
```

I hope this code hint helps you solve the problem!
