# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program that checks whether a character is in the alphabet or not. The alphabet is a set of letters that are used to form words. In English, the alphabet consists of 26 letters: 26 lowercase letters (a-z) and 26 uppercase letters (A-Z).

To solve this problem, you can use the following algorithm:

1. Get the character from the user.
2. Check whether the character is in the range of lowercase or uppercase alphabet letters.
3. If the character is in the range, then the character is in the alphabet. Otherwise, the character is not in the alphabet.

Here is a pseudocode for the algorithm:

```
def is_alphabet(character):
  """
  Checks whether a character is in the alphabet.

  Args:
    character: The character to check.

  Returns:
    True if the character is in the alphabet, False otherwise.
  """

  lower_alphabet_range = ord('a')
  upper_alphabet_range = ord('A')
  upper_alphabet_end_range = ord('Z')

  if ord(character) >= lower_alphabet_range and ord(character) <= 122:
    return True
  elif ord(character) >= upper_alphabet_range and ord(character) <= upper_alphabet_end_range:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

I hope this helps!
