# Here is the code guide for the program to check whether a character is in the alphabet or not:

## The Problem

The problem is to write a program that checks whether a character is in the alphabet or not. The alphabet consists of all the lowercase and uppercase letters from a to z and A to Z.

## Code Explanation

The code first declares a Scanner object to read input from the user. Then, it prompts the user to enter a character and stores the input in a variable named `character`.

Next, the code calls the `Character.isLetter()` method to check whether the `character` variable is a letter. The `Character.isLetter()` method returns a boolean value. If the value is `true`, then the `character` variable is a letter. Otherwise, the `character` variable is not a letter.

Finally, the code prints a message indicating whether the `character` variable is in the alphabet or not.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class check_alphabet {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a character: ");
        char character = scanner.next().charAt(0);

        boolean isLetter = Character.isLetter(character);

        if (isLetter) {
            System.out.println(character + " is in the alphabet.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(character + " is not in the alphabet.");
        }
    }
}
```

* The `import java.util.Scanner;` statement imports the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `public class check_alphabet {` statement declares a class named `check_alphabet`.
* The `public static void main(String[] args) {` statement declares the `main()` method. The `main()` method is the entry point for the program.
* The `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);` statement creates a new `Scanner` object. The `Scanner` object is used to read input from the user.
* The `System.out.print("Enter a character: ");` statement prints a message to the console prompting the user to enter a character.
* The `char character = scanner.next().charAt(0);` statement reads a character from the user and stores it in the `character` variable. The `next()` method of the `Scanner` object reads a string from the user. The `charAt(0)` method of the `String` class returns the first character of the string.
* The `boolean isLetter = Character.isLetter(character);` statement calls the `Character.isLetter()` method to check whether the `character` variable is a letter. The `Character.isLetter()` method returns a boolean value. If the value is `true`, then the `character` variable is a letter. Otherwise, the `character` variable is not a letter.
* The `if (isLetter) {` statement checks whether the value of the `isLetter` variable is `true`. If it is, then the code inside the `if` block is executed. Otherwise, the code inside the `if` block is skipped.
* The `System.out.println(character + " is in the alphabet.");` statement prints a message to the console indicating that the `character` variable is in the alphabet.
* The `else {` statement is executed if the value of the `isLetter` variable is `false`.
* The `System.out.println(character + " is not in the alphabet.");` statement prints a message to the console indicating that the `character` variable is not in the alphabet.
* The `}//end of main()` statement marks the end of the `main()` method.
* The `}//end of class check_alphabet` statement marks the end of the `check_alphabet` class.
