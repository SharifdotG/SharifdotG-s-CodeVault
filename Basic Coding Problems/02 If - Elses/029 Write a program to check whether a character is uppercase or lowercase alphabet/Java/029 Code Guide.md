# Here is the code guide for the program to check whether a character is uppercase or lowercase alphabet:

## Problem

The problem is to write a program that checks whether a character is uppercase or lowercase alphabet.

## Code Explanation

The code first imports the `java.util.Scanner` class, which is used to read input from the user. Then, it defines a `main()` method, which is the entry point of the program.

The `main()` method first creates a `Scanner` object and prompts the user to enter a character. The user's input is stored in a variable named `character`.

The next step is to check whether the character is uppercase or lowercase alphabet. This is done using the `Character.isUpperCase()` method. If the method returns `true`, then the character is uppercase alphabet. Otherwise, the character is lowercase alphabet.

Finally, the program prints a message to the console indicating whether the character is uppercase or lowercase alphabet.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class uppercase_lowercase_alphabet {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a character: ");
        char character = scanner.next().charAt(0);

        if (Character.isUpperCase(character)) {
            System.out.println("The character is uppercase alphabet.");
        } else if (Character.isLowerCase(character)) {
            System.out.println("The character is lowercase alphabet.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The character is not an alphabet.");
        }
    }
}
```

* The `import java.util.Scanner;` statement imports the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `public class uppercase_lowercase_alphabet {` statement declares a class named `uppercase_lowercase_alphabet`. This class contains the code for the program.
* The `public static void main(String[] args) {` statement declares a `main()` method. The `main()` method is the entry point of the program.
* The `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);` statement creates a `Scanner` object named `scanner`. The `Scanner` object is used to read input from the user.
* The `System.out.print("Enter a character: ");` statement prompts the user to enter a character.
* The `char character = scanner.next().charAt(0);` statement stores the user's input in a variable named `character`. The `next()` method of the `Scanner` object reads the next token of input from the user. The `charAt(0)` method of the `String` class returns the first character of a string.
* The `if (Character.isUpperCase(character)) {` statement checks whether the character is uppercase alphabet. The `Character.isUpperCase()` method returns `true` if the character is uppercase alphabet. Otherwise, the method returns `false`.
* The `System.out.println("The character is uppercase alphabet.");` statement prints a message to the console indicating that the character is uppercase alphabet.
* The `else if (Character.isLowerCase(character)) {` statement checks whether the character is lowercase alphabet. The `Character.isLowerCase()` method returns `true` if the character is lowercase alphabet. Otherwise, the method returns `false`.
* The `System.out.println("The character is lowercase alphabet.");` statement prints a message to the console indicating that the character is lowercase alphabet.
* The `else {` statement is executed if the character is not an alphabet.
* The `System.out.println("The character is not an alphabet.");` statement prints a message to the console indicating that the character is not an alphabet.
* The `}.` statement terminates the `if` statement.
* The `}.` statement terminates the `main()` method.
* The `}` statement terminates the `uppercase_lowercase_alphabet` class.
