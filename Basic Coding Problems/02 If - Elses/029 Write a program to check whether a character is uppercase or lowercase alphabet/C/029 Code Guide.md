# Here is the code guide for the program to check whether a character is uppercase or lowercase alphabet:

## The Problem

The problem is to write a program that checks whether a character is uppercase or lowercase alphabet. The program should first prompt the user to enter a character. Then, the program should check the ASCII value of the character. If the ASCII value of the character is between 65 and 90, then the character is uppercase alphabet. If the ASCII value of the character is between 97 and 122, then the character is lowercase alphabet. Otherwise, the character is not an alphabet.

## Code Explanation

The code for the program is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char character;

    printf("Enter a character: ");
    scanf("%c", &character);

    if (character >= 'A' && character <= 'Z') {
        printf("The character is uppercase alphabet.\n");
    } else if (character >= 'a' && character <= 'z') {
        printf("The character is lowercase alphabet.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The character is not an alphabet.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code, `#include <stdio.h>`, includes the `stdio.h` header file, which contains the declarations for the `printf()` and `scanf()` functions.

The next line of code, `int main()`, declares the `main()` function, which is the entry point for the program.

The next few lines of code prompt the user to enter a character and store the character in the `character` variable.

The next line of code, `if (character >= 'A' && character <= 'Z')`, checks if the ASCII value of the `character` variable is between 65 and 90. If it is, then the character is uppercase alphabet and the program prints the message "The character is uppercase alphabet."

The next line of code, `else if (character >= 'a' && character <= 'z')`, checks if the ASCII value of the `character` variable is between 97 and 122. If it is, then the character is lowercase alphabet and the program prints the message "The character is lowercase alphabet."

The else statement, `else`, is executed if the character is not an alphabet. In this case, the program prints the message "The character is not an alphabet."

The last line of code, `return 0;`, returns the value 0 from the `main()` function, which indicates that the program terminated successfully.
