# Here is the code guide for the problem of checking whether a character is uppercase or lowercase alphabet in C++:

## Problem

The problem is to write a program that checks whether a character is uppercase or lowercase alphabet. The program should first ask the user to enter a character. Then, the program should check the ASCII value of the character. If the ASCII value of the character is between 65 and 90, then the character is uppercase alphabet. If the ASCII value of the character is between 97 and 122, then the character is lowercase alphabet. Otherwise, the character is not an alphabet.

## Code Explanation

The code for the problem is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    char character;

    cout << "Enter a character: ";
    cin >> character;

    if (character >= 'A' && character <= 'Z') {
        cout << "The character is uppercase alphabet.\n";
    } else if (character >= 'a' && character <= 'z') {
        cout << "The character is lowercase alphabet.\n";
    } else {
        cout << "The character is not an alphabet.\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The first line of code includes the `iostream` header file, which contains the `cout` and `cin` objects used to print and read text from the console. The next line of code uses the `using namespace std` statement to bring all the names from the `std` namespace into the current scope. This makes it easier to write the code, as we can now refer to the `cout` and `cin` objects without having to prefix them with the `std::` namespace.

The next few lines of code define the `character` variable and ask the user to enter a character. The `cin >> character` statement reads a character from the console and stores it in the `character` variable.

The next few lines of code use an `if` statement to check the ASCII value of the `character` variable. If the ASCII value of the character is between 65 and 90, then the character is uppercase alphabet. If the ASCII value of the character is between 97 and 122, then the character is lowercase alphabet. Otherwise, the character is not an alphabet.

The `cout` object is used to print the appropriate message to the console.

The `return 0` statement tells the operating system that the program has completed successfully.
