# Here is the Code Guide for the program to find the maximum between three numbers:

**Problem**

The problem is to write a program that takes three numbers as input and prints the maximum number.

**Code Explanation**

The code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class maximum_between_three_numbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter three numbers: ");
        int num1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();
        int num3 = scanner.nextInt();

        int maxNum = num1;
        if (num2 > maxNum) {
            maxNum = num2;
        }
        if (num3 > maxNum) {
            maxNum = num3;
        }

        System.out.println("The maximum number is: " + maxNum);
    }
}
```

The first step is to declare a Scanner object to read input from the user. Then, the three numbers are read from the user and stored in the variables `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.

Next, the variable `maxNum` is initialized to the value of `num1`. This is because we assume that `num1` is the maximum number initially.

Then, we use an `if` statement to check if `num2` is greater than `maxNum`. If it is, then we update the value of `maxNum` to `num2`.

We repeat the same process for `num3`.

Finally, we print the value of `maxNum` which is the maximum number.

**Conclusion**

This is a simple program that shows how to find the maximum between three numbers. The code is well-commented and easy to understand. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment in the repository.
