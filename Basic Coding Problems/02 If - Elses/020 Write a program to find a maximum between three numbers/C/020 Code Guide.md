## Understanding the Problem

The problem is to write a C program to find a maximum between three numbers. The program should first ask the user to enter three numbers. Then, it should compare the three numbers and print the maximum number.

## Approaching the Problem

The following steps can be used to approach the problem:

1. Declare three variables to store the three numbers entered by the user.
2. Prompt the user to enter three numbers.
3. Read the three numbers entered by the user into the variables declared in step 1.
4. Compare the three numbers and find the maximum number.
5. Print the maximum number.

## Solving the Problem

The following code solves the problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

    int first_number;
    int second_number;
    int third_number;

    printf("Enter three numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d %d", &first_number, &second_number, &third_number);

    if (first_number > second_number && first_number > third_number) {
        printf("%d is the maximum number", first_number);
    } else if (second_number > first_number && second_number > third_number) {
        printf("%d is the maximum number", second_number);
    } else {
        printf("%d is the maximum number", third_number);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The code first declares three variables to store the three numbers entered by the user. Then, it prompts the user to enter three numbers. The code then reads the three numbers entered by the user into the variables declared in step 1.

Next, the code compares the three numbers and finds the maximum number. The code uses the `if` statement to compare the three numbers. If the first number is greater than the second number and the third number, then the first number is the maximum number. Otherwise, if the second number is greater than the first number and the third number, then the second number is the maximum number. Otherwise, the third number is the maximum number.

Finally, the code prints the maximum number.
