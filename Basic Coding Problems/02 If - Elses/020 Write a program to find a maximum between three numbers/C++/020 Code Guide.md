# Here is the Code Guide for the problem of finding a maximum between three numbers:

## The Problem

The problem is to write a program that takes three numbers as input and prints the maximum number.

## Code Explanation

The code is as follows:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num1, num2, num3;
    cout << "Enter three numbers: ";
    cin >> num1 >> num2 >> num3;

    int max_num = num1;
    if (num2 > max_num) {
        max_num = num2;
    } else if (num3 > max_num) {
        max_num = num3;
    }

    cout << max_num << " is the maximum number\n";
    return 0;
}
```

The first step is to declare three variables, `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`, to store the three numbers. Then, the user is prompted to enter the three numbers.

The next step is to initialize a variable `max_num` to the value of `num1`. This is the initial guess for the maximum number. Then, we use an `if` statement to check if `num2` is greater than `max_num`. If it is, then we update `max_num` to the value of `num2`. We do the same thing for `num3`.

Finally, we print the value of `max_num`, which is the maximum number.

## Conclusion

This code can be used to find the maximum between three numbers. If you have any questions, please feel free to comment in the repository.

Here are some additional notes about the code:

* The `using namespace std;` statement is used to import all the symbols from the `std` namespace. This is a common practice in C++.
* The `cout` object is used to print output to the console.
* The `cin` object is used to read input from the user.
* The `if` statement is used to test a condition and execute a block of code if the condition is true.
* The `else` statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition in the `if` statement is false.

I hope this Code Guide is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
