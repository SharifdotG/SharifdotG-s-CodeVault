# CODE HINT - Read This Before You See The Code!

This problem asks you to write a program to find the maximum between three numbers. The maximum number is the largest of the three numbers. For example, if the three numbers are 10, 5, and 15, then the maximum number is 15.

To solve this problem, you can use the following steps:

1. Declare three variables to store the three numbers.
2. Compare the three numbers and find the largest one.
3. Print the largest number.

Here is an algorithm for finding the maximum between three numbers:

```
1. Declare three variables to store the three numbers.
2. Compare the three numbers and find the largest one.
3. If the first number is the largest, then print the first number.
4. If the second number is the largest, then print the second number.
5. Otherwise, print the third number.
```

Here is a pseudocode for finding the maximum between three numbers:

```
procedure find_maximum(num1, num2, num3)
    if num1 > num2 and num1 > num3 then
        maximum = num1
    elif num2 > num1 and num2 > num3 then
        maximum = num2
    else
        maximum = num3
    print maximum
end procedure
```

I hope this helps!
