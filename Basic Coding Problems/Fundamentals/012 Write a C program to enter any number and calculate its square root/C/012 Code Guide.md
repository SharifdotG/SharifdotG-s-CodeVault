# Here is the guideline for the problem:

## Understanding the Problem

The problem is to write a C program that can enter any number and calculate its square root. The program should first ask the user to enter a number. Then, it should use the `sqrt()` function from the `math.h` header file to calculate the square root of the number. Finally, it should print the square root to the console.

## Approaching the Problem

The following steps can be used to approach the problem:

1. Declare the variables that will be used in the program.
2. Prompt the user to enter a number.
3. Read the number entered by the user and store it in a variable.
4. Calculate the square root of the number and store it in a variable.
5. Print the square root to the console.

## Solving the Problem

The following code solves the problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {

  int number;
  float square_root;

  printf("Enter a number: ");
  scanf("%d", &number);

  square_root = sqrt(number);

  printf("The square root of %d is %f\n", number, square_root);

  return 0;
}
```

This code first declares the variables `number` and `square_root`. Then, it prompts the user to enter a number. The number entered by the user is stored in the `number` variable. The `sqrt()` function is then used to calculate the square root of the `number` variable. The square root is stored in the `square_root` variable. Finally, the `square_root` variable is printed to the console.
