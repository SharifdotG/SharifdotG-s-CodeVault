# Here is the guideline for the problem:

## Understanding the problem

The problem is to write a C program to enter temperature in Celsius and convert it into Fahrenheit. The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

```
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
```

The program should prompt the user to enter the temperature in Celsius, then calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit and print it to the console.

## Approaching the problem

The first step is to declare the variables that will be used in the program. These variables are:

* `celsius`: The temperature in Celsius.
* `fahrenheit`: The temperature in Fahrenheit.

The next step is to prompt the user to enter the temperature in Celsius. This can be done using the `printf()` function.

```
printf("Enter temperature in Celsius: ");
```

The next step is to read the temperature from the user. This can be done using the `scanf()` function.

```
scanf("%f", &celsius);
```

The next step is to calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit. This can be done using the following code:

```
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;
```

The final step is to print the temperature in Fahrenheit to the console. This can be done using the `printf()` function.

```
printf("Temperature in Fahrenheit: %f\n", fahrenheit);
```

## Solving the problem

The complete code for the program is shown below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  float celsius;
  float fahrenheit;

  printf("Enter temperature in Celsius: ");
  scanf("%f", &celsius);

  fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;

  printf("Temperature in Fahrenheit: %f\n", fahrenheit);

  return 0;
}
```
