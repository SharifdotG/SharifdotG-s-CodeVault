# Here are some guidelines on how to understand, approach, and solve the problem:

## Understand the problem

The first step is to understand the problem. What are you being asked to do? In this case, you are being asked to write a C program that will:

1. Enter two numbers from the user.
2. Perform all arithmetic operations on the two numbers.
3. Print the results of the arithmetic operations.

## Approach the problem

Once you understand the problem, you need to approach it in a systematic way. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. Declare the variables you will need. In this case, you will need two variables to store the two numbers entered by the user.
2. Prompt the user for two numbers. You can use the `printf()` function to print a prompt and the `scanf()` function to read the user's input.
3. Calculate the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder of the two numbers. You can use the `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` operators to perform these operations.
4. Print the results of the arithmetic operations. You can use the `printf()` function to print the results.

## Solve the problem

Now that you have a plan, you can start coding. Here is the complete code for the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    // Declare variables.
    int a, b;

    // Prompt the user for two numbers.
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    // Calculate the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder of the two numbers.
    int sum = a + b;
    int difference = a - b;
    int product = a * b;
    int quotient = a / b;
    int remainder = a % b;

    // Print the results.
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    printf("Difference: %d\n", difference);
    printf("Product: %d\n", product);
    printf("Quotient: %d\n", quotient);
    printf("Remainder: %d\n", remainder);

    // Return 0 to indicate success.
    return 0;
}
```
