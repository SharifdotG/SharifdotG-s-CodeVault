# Here is the guideline for the C program to calculate the area of an equilateral triangle:

**Understanding the problem**

The problem is to write a C program that calculates the area of an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle is a triangle with all three sides of equal length. The area of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the following formula:

```
area = (sqrt(3) / 4) * side * side
```

where `side` is the length of one of the sides of the triangle.

**Approaching the problem**

The first step in solving this problem is to define the variables that will be used in the program. The following variables are needed:

* `side`: The length of one of the sides of the triangle.
* `area`: The area of the triangle.

The next step is to write the code that prompts the user to enter the side length of the triangle. The following code can be used to do this:

```
printf("Enter the side of the equilateral triangle: ");
scanf("%f", &side);
```

The next step is to write the code that calculates the area of the triangle. The following code can be used to do this:

```
area = (sqrt(3) / 4) * side * side;
```

The final step is to write the code that prints the area of the triangle to the console. The following code can be used to do this:

```
printf("The area of the equilateral triangle is: %f\n", area);
```

**Solving the problem**

The complete C program to calculate the area of an equilateral triangle is shown below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {

  float side, area;

  printf("Enter the side of the equilateral triangle: ");
  scanf("%f", &side);

  area = (sqrt(3) / 4) * side * side;

  printf("The area of the equilateral triangle is: %f\n", area);

  return 0;
}
```
